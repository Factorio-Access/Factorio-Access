#--Chapter 1-- Length: 21
tutorial-chapter-1-step-1-header=Chapter 1, Welcome to Nauvis, you need iron
tutorial-chapter-1-step-1-detail=Chapter 1, Welcome to Nauvis, you need iron

tutorial-chapter-1-step-2-header=Status report: You need iron
tutorial-chapter-1-step-2-detail=You have survived the landing unharmed but your spaceship is completely wrecked. You will need to build a new rocket from scratch to get back to space. This will require plenty of resources and specialized buildings to process them. But to do any of that, you first need to acquire some iron.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-3-header=Walking around in telestep
tutorial-chapter-1-step-3-detail=You can walk around by pressing "__CONTROL__move-up__", "__CONTROL__move-left__", "__CONTROL__move-down__", "__CONTROL__move-right__", with the north direction being "__CONTROL__move-up__". As you walk, the cursor system will identify the terrain or the entity in front of you. When you press a new direction, you will only turn to the new direction on the first press, and you will take steps on the later presses. 

tutorial-chapter-1-step-4-header=Coordinate system
tutorial-chapter-1-step-4-detail=The coordinate system has been established with your crash site at point 0,0. You can check your cursor coordinate by pressing "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__". Walking East will increase the X coordinate and walking South will increase the Y coordinate. 1 unit forward means 1 tile forward, which is about 1 meter of distance.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-5-header=Walk among the spaceship wreckage
tutorial-chapter-1-step-5-detail=The main part of your crashed spaceship is just north of point 0,0. The smaller spaceship wreck pieces are mostly to your west around the coordinates of -20, 0. Try to walk over to one of them. 

tutorial-chapter-1-step-6-header=Reading entity descriptions
tutorial-chapter-1-step-6-detail=When you find an object or entity with your cursor, it reports some relevant information about the selected entity, such as whether a spaceship wreck piece you found contains any items such as iron plates. You can also press "__CONTROL__item-info__" to read the description for the selected entity. 

tutorial-chapter-1-step-7-header=Find a wreck piece
tutorial-chapter-1-step-7-detail=Walk among the spaceship wreck pieces until you find one that is reported to contain iron plates, which in this case are salvagable items.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-8-header=Fast item collection
tutorial-chapter-1-step-8-detail=You can quickly empty the output of a selected entity by pressing "__CONTROL__fast-entity-transfer-info__". Empty out a wreck piece now.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-9-header=Open player inventory
tutorial-chapter-1-step-9-detail=Items you collect are held in your own inventory. You can open or close this menu by pressing "__CONTROL__open-inventory__". Inventory menus such as this one are represented by rows of slots that can hold items in stacks of various sizes.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-10-header=Inventory navigation
tutorial-chapter-1-step-10-detail=In most menus, you can press "__CONTROL__move-up__", "__CONTROL__move-left__", "__CONTROL__move-down__", "__CONTROL__move-right__" to navigate between slots or menu lines. Going over the edge of an inventory will wrap around to the other side. For inventory menus you can also press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" to check the currently selected slot's position. Explore the items in your inventory, including the iron plates you might have just picked up and other items you had grabbed while evacuating the ship.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-11-header=Inventory item descriptions
tutorial-chapter-1-step-11-detail=For a selected item stack in the inventory, you can press "__CONTROL__item-info__" to read its description. Some items are buildings and so their description begin by specifying their dimensions when they are placed down. Examine the items you have now, and then close the inventory by pressing "__CONTROL__open-inventory__" again.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-12-header=Cursor Mode part 1
tutorial-chapter-1-step-12-detail=There might be more wreck pieces around with iron to salvage. However, it is inefficient to keep navigating around an object to find the others, so it is useful to control the cursor independently while your character stands still. This can be done in Cursor Mode. 

tutorial-chapter-1-step-13-header=Cursor Mode part 2
tutorial-chapter-1-step-13-detail=Press "__CONTROL__toggle-cursor__" to toggle Cursor Mode on or off. In this mode, the cursor moves by one tile every time you press a walking direction key or an arrow key. The detached cursor can move infinitely far away but most cursor based interactions with an entity require for it to be within your reaching distance, which is about 10 tiles.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-14-header=Cursor Mode part 3
tutorial-chapter-1-step-14-detail=Press "__CONTROL__return-cursor-to-player__" to return the cursor back to you. Press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" to read the cursor coordinates as usual, or press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-distance-and-direction__" to get the cursor's relative distance and direction from you.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-15-header=Use cursor mode to explore
tutorial-chapter-1-step-15-detail=Use cursor mode to further explore the crash site and collect any items you find from the wreck pieces by pressing "__CONTROL__fast-entity-transfer-info__" as before.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-16-header=Entity scanner tool part 1
tutorial-chapter-1-step-16-detail=While cursor mode makes movement faster, trying to find anything by chance is still not efficient. Therefore you can instead use your entity scanner tool. When you run a scan with it, it creates a snapshot of all the entities around you at that moment and creates an information list about them, including their positions.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-17-header=Entity scanner tool part 2
tutorial-chapter-1-step-17-detail=You can run a scan by pressing "__CONTROL__rescan__". This sorts the scan results list by distance from your character's current position. Individual distances to objects update automatically as you move, but to reorder the list according to a new reference position requires pressing "__CONTROL__scan-sort-by-distance__". Run a scan now.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-18-header=Entity scanner tool part 3
tutorial-chapter-1-step-18-detail=To navigate the scan results list, press "__CONTROL__scan-list-up__" and "__CONTROL__scan-list-down__".Press "__CONTROL__scan-list-middle__" to repeat the selected entry. Reading a list entry makes your cursor jump to that entity, and so you can explore around it using Cursor Mode. You can also read its description by pressing "__CONTROL__item-info-last-indexed__". Explore the scan list now.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-19-header=Entity scanner tool part 4
tutorial-chapter-1-step-19-detail=If two entities have the same name and properties, such as two small spaceship wreck pieces with iron plates in them, then they get listed in the same scanner list entry. This ensures that every new scanner list line is a new kind of entity. To switch between different instances of the same entity, you can press "__CONTROL__scan-selection-up__" or "__CONTROL__scan-selection-down__". You can use this to find individual spaceship wreck pieces if you want.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-20-header=Explore the spaceship wreck a little more
tutorial-chapter-1-step-20-detail=Test the scanner for a few minutes while you locate more spaceship wreck pieces, if any, and salvage from them.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-21-header=Navigation basics complete
tutorial-chapter-1-step-21-detail=You now have some salvaged iron to use, and the basics of navigation in the world and in inventories have been covered. However, you will need much more iron to do just about anything. Luckily, there appears to be iron ore found large patches across the surface, and so it is now time for some mining and smelting.


#--Chapter 2-- Length: ***
tutorial-chapter-2-step-1-header=Chapter 2, mining and smelting
tutorial-chapter-2-step-1-detail=Chapter 2, mining and smelting

tutorial-chapter-2-step-2-header=Scan for iron ore
tutorial-chapter-2-step-2-detail=Run the scanner and go through the scan results to find iron ore.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-3-header=Scan list category filters
tutorial-chapter-2-step-3-detail=To make the scan results list less crowded, you can filter it to include only a specific category of entities. Switch your filter categories by pressing "__CONTROL__scan-category-up__" or "__CONTROL__scan-category-down__". For example, when scanning for iron ore, you can switch to the scanner category of "Resources".

tutorial-chapter-2-step-4-header=Walk over to the iron ore patch
tutorial-chapter-2-step-4-header=Walk over to the iron ore patch. You can keep pressing "__CONTROL__scan-list-middle__" to keep track of its position as you walk.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-5-header=Smooth walking mode
tutorial-chapter-2-step-5-detail=An alternate to the current telestep walking mode is smooth walking mode, where pressing a direction key makes you immediately turn and run towards the relevant direction for as long as you hold down the key. Press "__CONTROL__toggle-walk__" to toggle your walking mode. While smooth walking, you are no longer locked to the coordinate grid and you can also run diagonally. Also in this mode, the cursor does not read the terrain of tiles in front of you. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-6-header=Mining iron ore
tutorial-chapter-2-step-6-detail=Once you have reached the iron ore patch, you can mine a selected ore tile by holding down "__CONTROL__mine-access-sounds__". It takes some time but the ore slowly buiilds up in your inventory. Mine 10 units of iron ore.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-7-header=Ore needs to smelted
tutorial-chapter-2-step-7-detail=The ore needs to be smelted in a furnace for it to be usable. You should have a small furnace unit in your inventory, among the emergency equipment you grabbed while evacuating the ship. Press "__CONTROL__open-inventory__" to open your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-8-header=Grab your furnace
tutorial-chapter-2-step-8-detail=Find the stone furnace in your inventory using the direction keys. You can take it in hand by pressing "__CONTROL__click-menu__" and then press "__CONTROL__close-menu-access__" to close the inventory. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-9-header=About items in hand
tutorial-chapter-2-step-9-detail=Your hand is attached to your cursor and it can hold one item stack. You can read what it is holding by pressing "__CONTROL__read-hand__" and you can empty your hand into your inventory by pressing "__CONTROL__pipette-tool-info__". Try now to put away the furnace and grab it again.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-10-header=Building previews from hand
tutorial-chapter-2-step-10-detail=If the stack in hand contains buildings, you can place them to build them. While your hand hovers over a tile, the cursor sometimes reports preview info about trying to place the building there. You can get additional preview info by pressing "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__". 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-11-header=Build the furnace
tutorial-chapter-2-step-11-detail=With the furnace in hand, walk 4 or 5 tiles into the ore patch and place down the furnace by pressing "__CONTROL__click-hand__". If you want to pick it back up later, you can mine it by holding down "__CONTROL__mine-access-sounds__". Mining it returns the furnace item to your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-12-header=Building status part 1
tutorial-chapter-2-step-12-detail=The furnace is now on the ground as a 2 by 2 building. You can check the status of any building by pressing "__CONTROL__read-entity-status__" on it. Check the furnace status now.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-13-header=Building status part 3
tutorial-chapter-2-step-13-detail=The furnace reports being out of fuel or raw materials. This is obvious right now since we are going to fill it up, but generally it is useful to check the status of a building to understand what is going on with it.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-14-header=Building menus part 1
tutorial-chapter-2-step-14-detail=You can open the menu of a building such as a furnace by pressing "__CONTROL__click-entity__". For most buildings, the menu is divided into multiple sectors, with each sector having its own inventory and its own purpose. You can review the currently opened menu and sector by pressing "__CONTROL__read-menu-name__".

tutorial-chapter-2-step-15-header=Building menus part 2
tutorial-chapter-2-step-15-detail=You can switch between sectors using "__CONTROL__switch-menu-or-gun__" and "__CONTROL__reverse-switch-menu-or-gun__". Switching to a new sector announces its name and how many slots its inventory has. One of the sectors for every building is the player inventory, available for convenience but with fewer features than usual. You can close the building menu by pressing "__CONTROL__close-menu-access__". 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-16-header=Add ore to a furnace
tutorial-chapter-2-step-16-detail=To get the furnace working, you will need to add the iron ore and some fuel. From the player inventory sector you can grab the iron ore stack into hand by pressing "__CONTROL__click-menu__". Then switch to the furnace input sector using "__CONTROL__switch-menu-or-gun__" and put down the stack in hand by pressing "__CONTROL__click-menu__". 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-17-header=Take solid fuel in hand
tutorial-chapter-2-step-17-detail=Now the furnace will need fuel to burn. You have some solid fuel among your emergency supplies, so you can use some of that. Find the solid fuel from your inventory and take it in hand. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-18-header=Smart drop the solid fuel
tutorial-chapter-2-step-18-detail=While you can insert all of the solid fuel into the furace, you will need some of it later. Therefore a different technique can be used for inserting it. Close all menus but keep the fuel in hand. Find the furnace with the cursor and press "__CONTROL__drop-cursor-info__" to do a smart drop. This will smart insert only one unit from the stack in hand into the appropriate sector of the selected building.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-19-header=Smart drop the solid fuel
tutorial-chapter-2-step-19-detail=Press "__CONTROL__drop-cursor-info__" over the furnace two more times. This will have 3 units inserted in total and the furnace should now be working, which is audible from its crackling sounds. 3 solid fuel units will be enough to smelt a full stack of 100 iron plates.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-20-header=Examine the working furnace
tutorial-chapter-2-step-20-detail=Examine the working furnace status and its sectors. Some of the input and fuel should have disappeared into the building while it is working. After some time, the processed output appears at the output sector. Every building continues working without stopping until it runs into an issue, such as missing inputs or full outputs. Furnaces burn fuel efficiently such that one unit of any fuel can be used for multiple smelting cycles, and when a furnace gets interrupted, a partially burned fuel item's remaining energy is stored without being wasted. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-21-header=Collect iron plates
tutorial-chapter-2-step-21-detail=Collect iron plates from the output sector of the furnace. You will need to mine more ore if you want to keep this furnace going, but you can use mining drills to do this for you.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-22-header=Mining drills
tutorial-chapter-2-step-22-detail=You also had a fuel-powered burner mining drill as part of your emergency equipment. You can set up this mining drill in such a way that it directly mines and drops ore into the furnace. This is more easily done in Cursor Mode.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-23-header=Building in Cursor Mode part 1
tutorial-chapter-2-step-23-detail=Open your inventory with "__CONTROL__open-inventory__" and grab the burner mining drill with "__CONTROL__click-menu__". Close the inventory by pressing "__CONTROL__close-menu-access__" and then enable Cursor Mode by pressing "__CONTROL__toggle-cursor__". This will make the build preview move around with the cursor while you stand still.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-24-header=Building in Cursor Mode part 2
tutorial-chapter-2-step-24-detail= The drill in hand is a 2 by 2 building, like the furnace on the ground. In Cursor Mode, a building is always held by its northwest corner (or its top left corner). This fact can be used to align buildings, as will be demonstrated now.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-25-header=Building in Cursor Mode part 3
tutorial-chapter-2-step-25-detail= With the drill in hand, move the cursor to the northwest corner of the furnace on the ground. You can check the selected part of the furnace by pressing "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__". This info will also report that the drill in hand is 2 by 2, meaning that it is directly over the furnace now.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-26-header=Building in Cursor Mode part 3
tutorial-chapter-2-step-26-detail=Press any direction key twice and then press "__CONTROL__click-hand__" to place. The drill has now moved 2 tiles and should now be placed wall to wall with the furnace. Note that the placement area needs to have some iron ore beneath it for this to work.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-27-header=Examine the mining drill
tutorial-chapter-2-step-27-detail=Examine the mining drill by opening its menu. Note that it does not have any input or output sectors. This is because mining drills collect inputs directly from the ore tiles below them and they eject their outputs directly from their output chutes, which face the same direction as the drills. If there is a container or a furnace in front of the output chute, then the drill fills it up. If nothing is in front of the output chute, then the ore falls to the ground and clogs the output chute. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-28-header=Rotate the mining drill
tutorial-chapter-2-step-28-detail=Based on mining drill properties explained, the drill placed down earlier needs to be rotated to face the furnace. Select the drill with the cursor and press "__CONTROL__rotate-building__" or "__CONTROL__reverse-rotate-building__" to rotate it to the correct direction. For example, if the furnace is located at the west of the drill, then the drill needs to face the west.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-29-header=Refuel the drill
tutorial-chapter-2-step-29-detail=The correctly rotated drill needs to be refueled. Grab solid fuel from your inventory as before and smart drop 4 units into the drill by pressing "__CONTROL__drop-cursor-info__" over it.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-30-header=Now iron is automated
tutorial-chapter-2-step-30-detail=Now that the drill and the furnace are both working, you now have an automatic supply of iron plates. However, you will run out of solid fuel soon and so you will need to start mining coal to keep your machines running.


#--Chapter 3-- Length: ***
tutorial-chapter-3-step-1-header=Chapter 3, Get coal and get crafting
tutorial-chapter-3-step-1-detail=Chapter 3, Get coal and get crafting

tutorial-chapter-3-step-2-header=Coal sources
tutorial-chapter-3-step-2-detail=Coal is an ideal fuel source. It has one third of the energy of solid fuel but it is abundant and can be used without processing. Like iron ore, coal can be mined from patches by hand or by using drills. It can also be found inside huge rocks that can be found across the surface. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-3-header=About fast travel
tutorial-chapter-3-step-3-detail=Before leaving your machines to go find coal, note that you will need to return to the iron ore patch several times. Therefore it would be good to set up a fast travel point here. You can set up fast travel points as reference points with descriptions, and you are also able to teleport to them using your mini teleporter tool.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-header=Create a fast travel point
tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-detail=Open the fast travel menu by pressing "__CONTROL__open-fast-travel-menu__" and follow the instructions to create a point near the furnace.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-5-header=Test the fast travel point
tutorial-chapter-3-step-5-detail=Test your fast travel point by walking a few steps away and opening the fast travel menu again with "__CONTROL__open-fast-travel-menu__", and then selecting the point and pressing "__CONTROL__click-menu__" to travel to it.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-6-header=Locate huge rocks
tutorial-chapter-3-step-6-detail=Now you are ready to search for huge rocks using the scanner tool. To recap on the scanner controls, you run a scan by pressing "__CONTROL__rescan__", and navigate the list with "__CONTROL__scan-list-up__" and "__CONTROL__scan-list-down__", or press "__CONTROL__scan-list-middle__" to reread. You can also switch your filter categories by pressing "__CONTROL__scan-category-up__" or "__CONTROL__scan-category-down__". 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-7-header=Teleporting
tutorial-chapter-3-step-7-detail=While you can walk to distant objects, the teleporter tool can also be used at any time to teleport to the cursor location by pressing "__CONTROL__teleport-to-cursor__". When you combine this feature with the scan list making the cursor jump to indexed entities, it means that you can simply teleport to any entity after finding it with the scanner.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-8-header=Find a huge rock
tutorial-chapter-3-step-8-detail=Walk or teleport to a huge rock. Make sure it is not simply a big rock, because only huge rocks contain coal. If you cannot find any huge rocks, you can mine coal from a coal patch instead.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-9-header=Mine huge rocks
tutorial-chapter-3-step-9-detail=Mine the rock by holding "__CONTROL__mine-access-sounds__". Now use the scanner to locate another one and repeat this process until you have at least one stack each of coal and stone, which means at least 80 units each. If you cannot find more rocks, use the coal or stone patches instead.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-10-header=Return to your iron area
tutorial-chapter-3-step-10-detail=Use the fast travel menu to return to your furnace and miner and collect iron plates from the furnace output sector. Next, open the building menus with "__CONTROL__click-entity__" and make sure to take out any remaining solid fuel from the buildings, and press "__CONTROL__pipette-tool-info__" to put the solid fuel into your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-11-header=Refuel the furnace with coal
tutorial-chapter-3-step-11-detail=Now that you have a fair amount of coal, you can use it instead, and insert larger amounts too. Take coal in hand from the inventory and hover it over the furnace like before. This time press "__CONTROL__fast-entity-split__". This will smart drop half of the stack in hand into the machine, which is 25 coal.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-12-header=Refuel the drill with coal
tutorial-chapter-3-step-12-detail=Read the stack in hand by pressing "__CONTROL__read-hand__" and note that the stack has been refilled using other coal stacks from the inventory. This is a feature of smart inserting. Now hover the cursor over the mining drill and drop a whole stack of coal into it by pressing "__CONTROL__fast-entity-transfer__". And with that, all three types of smart dropping have been covered.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-13-header=First crafting goals
tutorial-chapter-3-step-13-detail=With the fuel top up, you will soon have enough iron to craft many machines. You can begin to craft your first machines now, which will be new furnaces and new mining drills so that coal mining can be automated.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-14-header=Crafting menu part 1
tutorial-chapter-3-step-14-detail=The crafting menu is one of the player menus. You can open this menu by pressing "__CONTROL__open-inventory__" to open the player inventory menu and then pressing "__CONTROL__switch-menu-or-gun__" to switch to the crafting menu. This menu is similar to an inventory, but all its slots contain crafting recipes instead of item stacks.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-15-header=Crafting menu part 2
tutorial-chapter-3-step-15-detail=Crafting recipes are grouped into four item categories. You can switch category by pressing "__CONTROL__move-up__" or "__CONTROL__move-down__" and you can navigate the recipes within a category by pressing "__CONTROL__move-left__" or "__CONTROL__move-right__". Navigate to the "production" category and find the stone furnace recipe. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-16-header=Crafting menu part 3
tutorial-chapter-3-step-16-detail=For a selected recipe in the crafting menu, you can read the recipe ingredients and products by pressing "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__", or the raw ingredient names using "__CONTROL__read-cursor-distance-and-direction__", or you can read the product item description by pressing "__CONTROL__item-info__". Check the stone furnace recipe info now.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-17-header=Crafting menu part 4
tutorial-chapter-3-step-17-detail=You can craft 1 set of a selected crafting recipe by pressing "__CONTROL__click-menu__" and you can craft 5 units by pressing "__CONTROL__crafting-5__". Use these keys to craft 8 stone furnaces. The orders get added to your crafting queue while your character works on them.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-18-header=Manual crafting perks part 1
tutorial-chapter-3-step-18-detail=Next in the crafting menu, find burner mining drills within the "production" category. Press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" to check the ingredients needed. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-19-header=Manual crafting perks part 2
tutorial-chapter-3-step-19-detail=Note that the recipe includes stone furnaces that you already crafted, and iron gear wheels that you do not have. When you order to craft the drill, the crafting queue automatically adds iron gear wheel sets so that it can use them to make drills, and the queue automatically takes existing stone furnaces to save time. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-20-header=Craft 5 burner mining drills.
tutorial-chapter-3-step-20-detail=Craft 5 burner mining drills. You should have 3 stone furnaces left. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-21-header=Self-feeding coal supply part 1
tutorial-chapter-3-step-21-detail=Now that you have extra mining drills, you can use some to mine coal. Head over to the nearest coal patch and walk 5 steps towards the middle.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-22-header=Self-feeding coal supply part 2
tutorial-chapter-3-step-22-detail=Grab your stack of mining drills and press "__CONTROL__click-hand__" to place one down.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-23-header=Self-feeding coal supply part 3
tutorial-chapter-3-step-23-detail=Enable cursor mode and align the cursor with the northwest corner of the drill on the ground.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-24-header=Self-feeding coal supply part 4
tutorial-chapter-3-step-24-detail=Move 2 tiles in any direction and place the second drill. They are now wall to wall with each other.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-25-header=Self-feeding coal supply part 5
tutorial-chapter-3-step-25-detail=Rotate both mining drills so that they face into each other. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-26-header=Self-feeding coal supply part 6
tutorial-chapter-3-step-26-detail=Smart drop 1 unit of coal into 1 of the drills and now your self-replenishing coal supply is ready. Both drills mine from the ground and output into each other's fuel slots. You can smart collect a half or full stack from these drills every time you swing by. Just be careful to leave at least 1 coal unit in at least 1 drill so that the system keeps running.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-27-header=Coal supply secured
tutorial-chapter-3-step-27-detail=Set up a fast travel point next to your pair of coal drills. With your iron supply and coal supply secured, you can next move on to acquiring other resources.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-1-detail=Chapter 4, More resources and shortcuts

tutorial-chapter-4-step-2-header=More tutorial controls 1
tutorial-chapter-4-step-2-detail=In the tutorial system, it can help to review older chapters from time to time. To assist with this, you can skip between chapters by pressing "__CONTROL__help-chapter-next__" or "__CONTROL__help-chapter-back__".

tutorial-chapter-4-step-3-header=More tutorial controls 2
tutorial-chapter-4-step-3-detail=While you can read the summary for a tutorial step by pressing "__CONTROL__help-get-other__", you can also toggle summary mode by pressing "__CONTROL__help-toggle-header-mode__" so that you can browse older steps quickly.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-4-header=Prepare to mine copper
tutorial-chapter-4-step-4-detail=The next resource to automate is copper, which is needed in small amounts at first but becomes as important as iron later on. Use the scanner and make your way to the nearest copper patch. At the copper patch, a mining drill and a furnace needs to be set up and refueled, as done with the iron ore patch. You can use some shortcuts to speed up this process.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-5-header=About the quickbar
tutorial-chapter-4-step-5-detail=The quickbar is a shortcut system which lets you assign number keys to items in your inventory so that you can instantly grab an item in hand by pressing the numbner for it. You set up the quickbar shortcut for a selected item by taking it in hand and pressing "CONTROL + NUMBER" for the number key you want from 0 to 9.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-6-header=Set up your first quickbar
tutorial-chapter-4-step-6-detail=A highly recommended quickbar setup for this chapter is to assign coal to number 1, burner mining drills to number 2, and stone furnaces to number 3. This will save you from a lot of searching through your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-7-header=About quickbar pages
tutorial-chapter-4-step-7-detail=You actually have not 1 but 10 quickbars. You can swap to a different quickbar by pressing "CONTROL + NUMBER" for the number key you want from 0 to 9. It is useful to set up different quickbars for different tasks, which will become more numerous as you unlock new technologies.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-8-header=Set up copper smelting
tutorial-chapter-4-step-8-detail=Using the quickbar, set up a burner mining drill and a furnace so that you can produce copper plates. Smart drop some coal in them both and finally set up a fast travel point here.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-9-header=Next comes wood
tutorial-chapter-4-step-9-detail=With copper sorted, next comes wood. You obtain wood by chopping down trees but the trees cannot be regrown and so there is no simple way to automate this. Luckily you do not need that much wood.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-10-header=Scan for trees
tutorial-chapter-4-step-10-detail=The entity scanner is able to report individual trees within 25 tiles but it has been optimized to find entire forests instead. Scan for a forest, and make your way to it.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-11-header=Area mining
tutorial-chapter-4-step-11-detail=In a forest, you can cut individual trees by mining them with "__CONTROL__mine-access-sounds__". However, you can also use the shortcut for area mining, which is "__CONTROL__mine-area__". When you run area mining, all trees rocks, dropped items, and other such obstacles within a 10 tile radius get instantly mined. This saves a lot time.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-12-header=Collect more wood
tutorial-chapter-4-step-12-detail=Continue chopping trees until you have one stack of wood, which is 50 units.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-13-header=Using wood
tutorial-chapter-4-step-13-detail=Wood can be used as a low-quality fuel, but it is mainly used for making wooden chests and electric poles. Crafting a few chests now would be useful. Open the crafting menu. For recap, press "__CONTROL__open-inventory__" to open your inventory and then press "__CONTROL__switch-menu-or-gun__" to switch to the crafting tab.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-14-header=Menu search part 1
tutorial-chapter-4-step-14-detail=While you can manually navigate the crafting menu to find the correct recipe, you can also use the menu search system to find a recipe or item quickly. Press "__CONTROL__menu-search-open__" to open the menu search box and write in "wood".

tutorial-chapter-4-step-15-header=Menu search part 2
tutorial-chapter-4-step-15-detail=When you have set your search query, you run the search by pressing "__CONTROL__menu-search-get-next__". Each press will jump you to a different matching item, if any are found. 

tutorial-chapter-4-step-16-header=Craft wooden chests
tutorial-chapter-4-step-16-detail=Use the search to find the wooden chest recipe and then craft 5 of them. This will cover all the wood requirements for now.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-17-header=Moving on to stone
tutorial-chapter-4-step-17-detail=Next, you can move onto automating your stone supply. Use the scanner and make your way to the nearest stone patch. Stone is useful both in its raw form and its smelted form of stone bricks, and so you will build 2 setups.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-18-header=Start mining stone
tutorial-chapter-4-step-18-detail=Place down a mining drill by itself in the middle of the stone patch and add fuel to it. Note that it drops one unit on the ground and then stops due to its output being full. The stone item on the ground marks where the output is. 

tutorial-chapter-4-step-19-header=Stone collection chest
tutorial-chapter-4-step-19-detail=Grab your wooden chest stack place a chest on top of the stone item on the ground, in front of the miner's output chute. This will make you replace the ground item with the chest, and now the drill will be able to output into the chest.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-20-header=Setup stone brick production
tutorial-chapter-4-step-20-detail=Use quickbar shortcuts to set up a furnace and a burner mining drill like with the iron ore patch. Smart drop some coal in them both and finally set up a fast travel point here.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-21-header=About stone bricks
tutorial-chapter-4-step-21-detail=Stone bricks are used when crafting some buildings, but they are also usable for paving paths on the ground. Take some stone bricks in hand.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-22-header=Paving
tutorial-chapter-4-step-22-detail=When you hold stone bricks in hand, the cursor begins to preview paving the ground. Press "__CONTROL__click-hand__" to pave over a tile and press "__CONTROL__mine-access-sounds__" to remove a paving from a tile. 1 brick paves over 1 tile exactly. Paved ground is faster to run on and it can be used to mark roads for players or vehicles to follow.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-23-header=Larger cursor sizes part 1
tutorial-chapter-4-step-23-detail=If you want to pave over larger areas quickly, you can resize the cursor. This also enables area scanning, which is feature of cursor mode.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-24-header=Larger cursor sizes part 2
tutorial-chapter-4-step-24-detail=Press "__CONTROL__cursor-size-increment__" to increase the cursor size and press "__CONTROL__cursor-size-decrement__" to decrease it. If you enabled Cursor Mode, the enlarged cursor box now reports a summary of what is inmside its area. If you are holding stone bricks, you can pave the entire area in one key press.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-25-header=Larger cursor sizes part 3
tutorial-chapter-4-step-25-detail=When you have an enlarged cursor, pressing walking direction keys move the cursor by its own size with each press, such that any two neighboring areas scanned this way do not overlap. Alternatively if you want to use a large cursor and move it by only 1 tile, you can do this using arrow keys.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-26-header=Return to the iron patch
tutorial-chapter-4-step-26-detail=With the other resources now covered, the focus returns to increasing iron production. Press "__CONTROL__cursor-size-decrement__" until cursor size returns to 1. Then, return to the iron patch fast travel location.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-27-header=Craft more items
tutorial-chapter-4-step-27-detail=Craft 5 burner mining drills and 3 stone furnaces.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-28-header=About the pipette tool 
tutorial-chapter-4-step-28-detail=While adding more iron production, the pipette tool shortcut can be used by pressing "__CONTROL__pipette-tool-info__". This tool works like the quickbar, except it brings to your hand the item selected by the cursor instead of a previously assigned item. For example, if the cursor is selecting a furnace and you have furnaces in your inventory, pressing "__CONTROL__pipette-tool-info__" will bring a stack of furnaces to your hand.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-29-header=Using the pipette tool, build more iron production 
tutorial-chapter-4-step-29-detail=Using the pipette tool instead of the quickbar, build two more furnaces and mining drills each for producing iron plates.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-30-header=Refuel your different areas
tutorial-chapter-4-step-30-detail=Having built quite a few furnaces and mining drills, it is now a good idea to visit your coal patch to grab coal and go to the other patches to refuel your other machines.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-31-header=All resources covered
tutorial-chapter-4-step-31-detail=You now have a fair amount of wood and a steady supply of iron, coal, copper, stone, and stone bricks. You can consider this as your first factory, ready to produce everything you need for building a bigger and better factory. The only major problem right now is that you need to keep running around to resupply coal. This will be addressed next.


#--Chapter 5-- Length:
tutorial-chapter-5-step-1-header=Chapter 5, Belts and inserters 
tutorial-chapter-5-step-1-detail=Chapter 5, Belts and inserters 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-2-header=Why you need belts and inserters
tutorial-chapter-5-step-2-detail=Manually collecting, transporting, and inserting coal for so many machines can become tedious rather quickly. Now that you have a good iron supply, you can build transport belts and burner inserters to handle these tasks for you.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-3-header=Craft machines for the coal supply belt
tutorial-chapter-5-step-3-detail=Using iron plates, craft 15 transport belt units, 15 burner inserters, and 15 pipes, all from the logistics category. Also craft 6 burner mining drills, from the production category. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-4-header=Head to the coal patch
tutorial-chapter-5-step-4-detail=Head to your coal patch and stand inside it, at least 2 tiles away from the edges. Like all resource patches, it is roughly circular in shape, and you can find its approximate center by counting its height and width. A quick way to do this is with cursor skipping.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-5-header=About cursor skipping
tutorial-chapter-5-step-5-detail=Cursor skipping is a cursor mode feature where repeating entities or repeating empty tiles get skipped until the cursor reaches something new. You make the cursor skip along a direction by holding "SHIFT" while you press that direction. This logic can be used to measure the heights and widths of resource patches.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-6-header=Find the coal patch center point part 1
tutorial-chapter-5-step-6-detail=In Cursor Mode, pick a tile within the coal patch and press "SHIFT + W" to skip to the north. The cursor will skip over repeating coal tiles until it finds something else such as a tree or a rock standing over the coal, or an empty tile at the edge of the coal patch. Skip again if you find a tree or rock, until you find an empty ground tile.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-7-header=Find the coal patch center point part 2
tutorial-chapter-5-step-7-detail=Move the cursor 1 tile south so that it is now at the north edge of the coal patch. Check its coordinates by pressing "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" and save them somewhere, maybe by creating a fast travel point temporarily.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-8-header=Find the coal patch center point part 3
tutorial-chapter-5-step-8-detail=Now to find the south edge of the coal patch, press "SHIFT + S" to skip the cursor south until you find the ground at the south edge. Note down these coordinates. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-9-header=Find the coal patch center point part 4
tutorial-chapter-5-step-9-detail=Find the approximate vertical middle of the coal patch by taking the average of the north and south edge coordinates. You can do this by adding the Y coordinate values and dividing the sum by 2. Note that typically the starting coal patch is around 20 to 40 tiles in height

tutorial-chapter-5-step-10-header=Find the coal patch center point part 5
tutorial-chapter-5-step-10-detail=From the middle point you found, skip cursor to the east and the west to find those edges, and similarly use their X coordinate values to find the approximate horizontal middle of the patch. Combining the average X and average Y values gives you the approximate center of the patch. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-11-header=Place a transport belt unit in the center of the coal patch
tutorial-chapter-5-step-11-detail=Place a transport belt unit in the center of the coal patch and stand next to it.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-12-header=Rotate the belt unit
tutorial-chapter-5-step-12-detail=Rotate the belt unit towards the direction of the nearest iron ore patch. You can find this direction by running a scan and checking the scan list entry for iron ore and you can rotate the belt by pressing "__CONTROL__rotate-building__". If the ore patch is at a diagonal direction, pick either one of the directions mentioned. The idea is to set up the belt to carry coal towards the iron area.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-13-header=Place belt units
tutorial-chapter-5-step-13-detail=Walk on top of the belt unit and place another unit in the same direction. Repeat this until your belt extends over the edge of the coal patch. With all belt units forming a line, you now have one long belt ready to carry coal for you. The belt does not require fuel or anything else to work, so this part of the system is good to go. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-14-header=About transport belts
tutorial-chapter-5-step-14-detail=All transport belts carry items on top of them in the direction they are facing and they do not need an energy source. Items on top of them can be dropped onto them and can be removed using inserters, and the items never fall off. Therefore items tend to queue up at the end of a belt when they have nowhere to go. The belts have two separate lanes on them and there are ways to mix these lanes, but you can safely ignore the lanes as long as you use only one type of item on the belt, such as a coal-only belt.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-15-header=Prepare to place the first drill
tutorial-chapter-5-step-15-detail=Head to the start of the belt and stand on the starting end. Use Cursor Mode to move 1 tile along the belt's direction. A mining drill will be placed at this spot.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-16-header=Place the first drill
tutorial-chapter-5-step-16-detail=Move the cursor off the belt by 1 tile and try to place a mining drill there. If the belt is in the way, you need to move 1 more tile away from the belt.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-17-header=Rotate the first drill
tutorial-chapter-5-step-17-detail=Now the drill needs to be rotated so that it outputs onto the belt. For example, if the belt is located at the East of the drill, the drill needs to face East. A correctly rotated drill will report that it outputs to the belt.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-18-header=Fuel up the first drill
tutorial-chapter-5-step-18-detail=Drop 10 units of coal into the drill. It should now start dropping newly mined coal onto the belt. If you walk to the stopping end of the belt, you should start to detect coal sitting there, which is what is needed. The coal should fill up the belt lane until the coal queue reaches the drill output and blocks it.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-19-header=Explaining the inserter logic
tutorial-chapter-5-step-19-detail=You now have a drill producing coal and dropping it onto the belt. However, the drill is unable to refuel itself and so a pair of inserters will be placed to take some of the coal from further along the belt and drop it back into the drill to keep it running. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-20-header=About burner inserters
tutorial-chapter-5-step-20-detail=An inserter is a machine that can smart collect an item from a building that is directly in front of it and then smart drop the item into a building that is directly behind it. Burner inserters work using fuel, and they can directly use some of the fuel held in their own hands to keep themselves running. In contrast, regular inserters do not need fuel but they need electric power, which will be set up later.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-21-header=Place a pipe unit for reference
tutorial-chapter-5-step-21-detail=Move the cursor to the coal patch tile that is next to the drill and one unit along the belt. Place a pipe unit here. This pipe unit simply functions as a reference point for placing the inserters. The pipe should be next to the drill and also next to a belt unit that has coal on it.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-22-header=Place the first burner inserter
tutorial-chapter-5-step-22-detail=After the pipe unit, on the next space along the belt, place a burner inserter. Rotate the inserter to make it face the belt unit next to it. This is also identical to the current direction of the mining drill.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-23-header=Place the second burner inserter
tutorial-chapter-5-step-23-detail=The pipe unit now has a machine on 3 of its 4 sides. On the 4th side, place the second burner inserter. Rotate this inserter to face the same direction as the transport belt's travel direction.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-24-header=Trace the coal unit path part 1
tutorial-chapter-5-step-24-detail=The setup is now complete. You now have coal units making a loop around the pipe unit. You can trace this loop with your cursor. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-25-header=Trace the coal unit path part 2
tutorial-chapter-5-step-25-detail=In the loop, the coal is first collected from the ground by the mining drill and dropped onto the belt. After travelling two tiles along the belt, the coal is picked up by the first inserter and dropped on the ground. The second inserter picks up the coal from the ground and drops it into the burner mining drill's fuel slot. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-26-header=Inserters do not completely fill buildings
tutorial-chapter-5-step-26-detail=Note that inserters do not completely fill buildings so that items in front of them can move along to buildings that need them more. In this case, the burner inserters will work only while there are less than 5 coal units in the mining drill's fuel slot.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-27-header=Mirror the drill setup part 1
tutorial-chapter-5-step-27-detail=Now this arrangement can be mirrored on the other side of the belt. Empty your hand and enable cursor mode. Then move the cursor to the northwest corner of the drill.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-28-header=Mirror the drill setup part 2
tutorial-chapter-5-step-28-detail=Press "__CONTROL__pipette-tool-info__" to use the pipette tool. This will bring to hand a mining drill that has the same direction as the one on the ground. Move exactly 3 tiles in this direction so that the cursor is now at the correct spot on the other side of the transport belt. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-29-header=Mirror the drill setup part 3
tutorial-chapter-5-step-29-detail=Press "__CONTROL__rotate-building__" twice to make the drill in hand face the opposite direction and place it down. Do not refuel this drill.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-30-header=Mirror the pipe placement
tutorial-chapter-5-step-30-detail=Like before, place a pipe unit next to the drill, one tile along the belt.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-31-header=Mirror the first inserter
tutorial-chapter-5-step-31-detail=Place an inserter after the pipe and rotate it to face the belt unit next to it. Note that this should be the opposide direction as the other inserter taking from the same belt unit.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-32-header=Mirror the second inserter
tutorial-chapter-5-step-32-detail=In the remaining empty side of the pipe unit place the other inserter. Rotate it to face the same direction as the belt's travel direction.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-33-header=Mirrored setup complete
tutorial-chapter-5-step-33-detail=The mirrored drill setup is now complete. Once again you can trace the loop from the drill to the belt to the inserters and back to the drill, but this time looping in the opposite direction. If the loop is correct, the second drill will be refueled automatically and begin working by itself.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-34-header=Coal belt basics complete
tutorial-chapter-5-step-34-detail=You now have the basic version of a transport belt that carries coal from a pair of self-feeding burner mining drills. However, two drills will not be enough and so this design with two drills needs to be repeated along the belt. Blueprints will be used to do this efficiently.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-1-header=Chapter 6, Blueprints for copying layouts
tutorial-chapter-6-step-1-detail=Chapter 6, Blueprints for copying layouts

tutorial-chapter-6-step-2-header=About blueprints
tutorial-chapter-6-step-2-detail=Now that you have the self-refueling drills set up on both sides of the belt, you can copy-paste this design along the belt using the blueprint system. Blueprints are planning tools that allow you to copy and paste the layouts of factory areas. First, one side of the belt will be copied.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-3-header=Consider removing the reference pipes
tutorial-chapter-6-step-3-detail=Before copying the designs, consider whether to remove the reference pipes, by mining them with "__CONTROL__mine-access-sounds__". While the pipes do not have a function other than building assistance, you may still prefer to keep them to reduce confusion. It is up to you.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-4-header=Grab a blueprint in hand 
tutorial-chapter-6-step-4-detail=Press "ALT + B" to grab a new empty blueprint item in hand for free. You will now begin to define the blueprint selection area. The logic of area selection is to pick the two opposite corners of a rectangle that covers the area. This is first demonstrated by blueprinting one side of the drill setup.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-5-header=Mark the first selection point 
tutorial-chapter-6-step-5-detail=Move the cursor to the corner of the burner mining drill that is nearest to the transport belt starting end, and press "__CONTROL__click-hand__" to mark the first corner of the blueprint selection area.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-6-header=Mark the second selection point 
tutorial-chapter-6-step-6-detail=Now move the cursor to the coal item on the ground tile in between the two inserters around the same pipe unit. Press "__CONTROL__click-hand__" to mark the second corner of the blueprint selection area. This will create the blueprint.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-7-header=Examine the blueprint
tutorial-chapter-6-step-7-detail=You now have a filled blueprint in hand. Press "__CONTROL__rightbracket-key-id__" to open the blueprint menu and explore the menu options to get information about the blueprint.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-8-header=Check the blueprint
tutorial-chapter-6-step-8-detail=Check whether the blueprint has been set up correctly by verifying that it contains 2 burner inserters, 1 burner mining drill, and 1 pipe. Also it should have a size of 2 by 4 tiles. If any of this information is incorrect, try the blueprint selection again. You can use one of the menu options for this.
#****add reselect

tutorial-chapter-6-step-9-header=Rename the blueprint
tutorial-chapter-6-step-0-detail=Use the blueprint menu to name this blueprint so that it will not get mixed up with future blueprints.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-10-header=Place the blueprint anywhere
tutorial-chapter-6-step-10-detail=With the blueprint in hand and using Cursor Mode, find an empty spot somewhere in the coal patch and try to place down the blueprint by pressing "__CONTROL__click-hand__".

tutorial-chapter-6-step-11-header=Examine the ghosts
tutorial-chapter-6-step-11-detail=Examine the placed objects, which appear in the form of ghosts instead of actual machines. The layout of the ghosts should match the layout of the area you selected for the blueprint. Note that the blueprint layout is always held from the northwest corner while in Cursor Mode.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-12-header=Clear the ghosts
tutorial-chapter-6-step-12-detail=The idea now is to place down the blueprint at a valid position further down the coal transport belt. But first, you can clear the randomly placed ghosts by selecting any of them and pressing "__CONTROL__mine-area__" to remove it and all other nearby ghosts.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-13-header=Align the blueprint
tutorial-chapter-6-step-13-detail=Take the blueprint in hand again and determine the position where it needs to go along the belt. It should be 4 tiles along the belt from the same position for the original setup. 

tutorial-chapter-6-step-14-header=Place and check the blueprint
tutorial-chapter-6-step-14-detail=Place down the blueprint by pressing "__CONTROL__click-hand__" and examine with the cursor whether the ghosts do form the expected coal item loop along the transport belt. If this is wrong, clear the ghosts and try again.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-15-header=Fill in the ghosts
tutorial-chapter-6-step-15-detail=When the ghosts have been correctly placed, it is easy to fill them in by using the smart pipette tool by pressing "__CONTROL__pipette-tool-info__". Using the tool on ghosts automatically moves the cursor to the correct position for building it. You find ghosts quickly using the scanner.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-16-header=New blueprint for mirrored setup
tutorial-chapter-6-step-16-detail=You should now have two copies of a drill setup on one side of your belt and one copy of the mirrored setup on the other side. Grab a new blueprint in hand by pressing "ALT + B" for copying the mirrored drill setup. 

tutorial-chapter-6-step-17-header=Mirrored first selection point
tutorial-chapter-6-step-17-detail=Again, select the drill's nearest corner to the transport belt's starting end and press "__CONTROL__click-hand__" to mark the first corner of the blueprint selection area.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-18-header=Mirrored second selection point 
tutorial-chapter-6-step-18-detail=Now move the cursor to the coal item on the ground tile in between the two inserters around the same pipe unit. Press "__CONTROL__click-hand__" to mark the second corner of the blueprint selection area. This will create the blueprint.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-19-header=Check the mirrored blueprint  
tutorial-chapter-6-step-19-detail=Check the new blueprint. Again, you should have a blueprint with 2 burner inserters, 1 burner mining drill, and 1 pipe. Select again if this is incorrect.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-20-header=Align and place the mirrored blueprint 
tutorial-chapter-6-step-20-detail=Align the blueprint to place a copy of the drill setup 4 tiles further along the belt. Remember that every blueprint in Cursor Mode is held from its northwest corner. 

tutorial-chapter-6-step-21-header=Fill in the mirrored blueprint ghosts
tutorial-chapter-6-step-21-detail=Fill in the mirrored blueprint ghosts. You should now have a total of 4 self-feeding coal drills that output to the belt.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-22-header=Add more drills to the belt
tutorial-chapter-6-step-22-detail=Use your two blueprints to copy more drill setups along the belt until you have 8 drills in total or you reach the edge of the coal patch.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-23-header=Add a chest at the end of the belt
tutorial-chapter-6-step-23-detail=Walk to the stopping end of your coal belt and place a burner inserter that takes from one side of the stopping end, but not from its front. Then place a chest behind this inserter. This chest becomes your coal supply chest and you may want to set up a fast travel point at it.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-24-header=The coal supply belt is now ready to use
tutorial-chapter-6-step-24-detail=The coal supply belt is now ready to use. Optionally, you can now extend the coal belt to the iron ore patch and use it to automatically supply the drills and furnaces there. However, it is more efficient to use electric mining drills because they are easier to set up and scale up. Therefore the instructions will continue by moving on to electricity production, which also requires a steady coal supply.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-1-header=Chapter 7, Water and power
tutorial-chapter-7-step-1-detail=Chapter 7, Water and power

tutorial-chapter-7-step-2-header=Why you need water and power
tutorial-chapter-7-step-2-detail=Electricity is required for powering important factory machines such as research labs, which are needed for developing the technologies that allow you to build advanced systems such as rockets. At the moment, electricity can only be generated using steam power, which requires a steady supply of coal and water. You have coal covered, so the focus now will be water.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-2-header=Craft an offshore pump and pipes
tutorial-chapter-7-step-2-detail=Water can be pumped out of lakes or seas and transported in pipes. To brgim, first craft 1 offshore pump and at least 100 pipes. Note that you will now need copper plates.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-3-header=Go to water
tutorial-chapter-7-step-3-detail=Use the scanner tool to locate the nearest water body. Water can be found in lakes similar to ore being found in patches, but the lakes can be a lot larger and they cannot be walked on. Make your way to the shore. Note that the scanner tool always reports the nearest edge of a large body such as a lake.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-4-header=Place the offshore pump.
tutorial-chapter-7-step-4-detail=Take the offshore pump from your inventory and press "__CONTROL__click-entity__" to run its special building assistant. The assistant will suggest good positions for placing the pump and the first suggestion is usually the nearest good position. Press "__CONTROL__click-menu__" to confirm this. The offshore pump will set up and will fill up with water instantly. It does not need any energy source so it is ready.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-5-header=Starting the water pipe
tutorial-chapter-7-step-5-detail=Take a stack of pipes in hand for transporting the water. Use Cursor Mode and maybe the scanner to locate the pump and then bring the cursor to the tile just next to the pump's output. Press "__CONTROL__click-entity__" to put down a pipe. If it is positioned correctly, the pipe will be full of water. Otherwise it will be empty.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-6-header=Extending the water pipe
tutorial-chapter-7-step-6-detail=Pipes will automatically connect to any neighboring pipes in any of the four main directions. Therefore you can put down more pipes along the first one to make an extended water pipe. You can also walk over pipes. Use the scanner tool to locate the coal patch and use Build Lock Mode to extend the water pipe all the way until just outside the edge of the patch.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-7-header=Crafting steam power machines
tutorial-chapter-7-step-7-detail=Now that you have a water supply, you can craft the buildings needed for steam power. Craft 1 boiler and 2 steam engines using iron plates and stone furnaces. You also need copper and wood now, because you should also craft 1 (regular electric) inserter and at least 1 small power pole.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-8-header=Place the boiler
tutorial-chapter-7-step-8-detail=Take the boiler in hand and use Cursor Mode. The boiler is a 3 by 2 building that has a water pipe along its back, and it has a steam output pipe on its front center. When the boiler is facing north, the water pipe ends are on its southeast and southwest corners, and its steam output is on the middle of its north side. Place it down somwhere near the end of the water pipe so that you can align it by nudging.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-9-header=Nudging buildings
tutorial-chapter-7-step-9-detail=To align buildings that you already placed down, you can nudge them by one tile at a time. This is done by pressing "CONTROL + SHIFT + DIRECTION KEY", where the direction key is "__CONTROL__move-up__" or "__CONTROL__move-left__" or "__CONTROL__move-down__" or "__CONTROL__move-right__". A nudged building can only be nudged into an empty spot. You can use this feature to make sure that the boiler is aligned correctly.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-10-header=Align the boiler
tutorial-chapter-7-step-10-detail=Nudge the boiler to get its back pipe aligned with the end of the water pipe. Any connection will work now but an aligned connection will make future constructions easier. The connected boiler will fill with water, and you can check the building to verify this. Place some coal in the aligned boiler to hear it start working and check that it now has steam in it.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-11-header=About the steam engine
tutorial-chapter-7-step-11-detail=The steam engine is a long building that is 3 by 5 tiles. Both of its short 3 tile sides provide access to a steam pipe that runs through the building and can move steam both in and out of the building. 

tutorial-chapter-7-step-12-header=Placing the steam engine part 1
tutorial-chapter-7-step-12-detail=To precisely place the steam engine, first make sure that the area in front of the boiler is clear for building. Then take the steam engine in hand and enable Cursor Mode. As always, the building is held from its top left corner in Cursor Mode, and when you press "K" to check the preview position, this also reports how far the preview extends to the East and the South.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-13-header=Placing the steam engine part 2
tutorial-chapter-7-step-13-detail=Rotate the steam engine to face the same direction as the boiler. Next, bring the cursor to overlap with the part of the boiler that has the steam output. 

tutorial-chapter-7-step-14-header=Placing the steam engine part 3
tutorial-chapter-7-step-14-detail=If the boiler is facing north, you now need to move 5 tiles north so that the length of the steam engine is covered and the other end is near the boiler output. If the boiler is facing south, you move just 1 tile south so that your end of the engine is near the boiler output. Similarly, you need to move 5 tiles if the boiler is facing west, or just 1 tile if it is facing east. 

tutorial-chapter-7-step-15-header=Placing the steam engine part 4
tutorial-chapter-7-step-15-detail=Next, you need to move the cursor 1 tile sideways so that the middle of the three-tiles-wide boiler and the middle of the three-tiles-wide steam engine are correctly aligned. If the alignment is correct, the steam engine will now fill with steam from the boiler, and you can check the machine to verify this. One boiler can support two steam engines, so you can place your second steam engine at the other end of the first one using the same aligning technique. Use nudging if needed.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-16-header=Testing your steam power system
tutorial-chapter-7-step-16-detail=Now that your boilers and engines are set up, you can test if the electric system works by giving it a load. Place a small electric pole next to each steam engine to create your electric grid. Place your third small electric pole next to the boiler, along its empty wide side, and finally place the electric inserter next the pole and the boiler. This will make your steam engines start to work at very low speed, and you will hear them hissing.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-17-header=Automated boiler fueling
tutorial-chapter-7-step-17-detail=Rotate the inserter that you just placed to face away from the boiler. If you place a chest of coal or a belt of coal in front of this inserter, it can be used to keep the boiler constantly fueled so that your power supply is continuous. Boilers and steam engines work smartly like furnaces such that they never waste any fuel or steam when there is a low power demand.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-18-header=Ready for labs
tutorial-chapter-7-step-18-detail=With your steam power system ready to go, you are finally ready to start using research labs so that you can build more advanced buildings and systems on your way to building a rocket.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-19-header=Quickbar recommendation
tutorial-chapter-7-step-19-detail=In preparation for the next part, consider setting up a quickbar to include coal and belts and many inserter types and also electric poles.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-1-detail=Chapter 8, Research and automation

tutorial-chapter-8-step-2-header=Craft 1 research lab
tutorial-chapter-8-step-2-detail=Craft 1 research lab and place it in an empty area near your steam engines.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-3-header=Power the lab
tutorial-chapter-8-step-3-detail=Place a small electric pole near your power network so that you can extend it. Keep extending it towards your lab so that it has power. You can check power pole connection previews in telestep walking mode or Cursor Mode.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-4-header=About research packs
tutorial-chapter-8-step-4-detail=Open the lab to examine its slots. As revealed here, research is done by consuming science packs and electric power at your labs to do experiments. Therefore the main items you need to produce in your factory are the different types of research packs.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-5-header=Craft automation science packs
tutorial-chapter-8-step-5-detail=Craft 10 automation science packs. You will need copper plates and iron gear wheels for this. Place the packs into the lab. The filled and powered lab will begin working when you later select a technology to research.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-6-header=Select to research "automation"
tutorial-chapter-8-step-6-detail= Open the technology menu by pressing "__CONTROL__open-inventory__" to open the inventory and pressing "__CONTROL__switch-menu-or-gun__" multiple times. In this menu, technologies are sorted according to whether they are already researched, available now for research, or locked due to prerequisites. You can change technology categories with "__CONTROL__move-up__" and "__CONTROL__move-down__" and you can navigate within a category with "__CONTROL__move-left__" and "__CONTROL__move-right__". Select the technology named "Automation" and press "__CONTROL__item-info__" to read about it, press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" to read its science pack requirements, and press "__CONTROL__click-menu__" to start researching it.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-7-header=Research progress
tutorial-chapter-8-step-7-detail=You can hear the electricity crackle as a lab works. You can check the planet's local time and current research progress by pressing "__CONTROL__read-time-and-research-progress__". You will hear the notification sound when the research is complete. Research progress is permanent such that you can interrupt one research to start another and then return to the first one without issues.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-8-header=About assembling machines
tutorial-chapter-8-step-8-detail=Researching "Automation" has unlocked the recipe for assembling machines, which are at the heart of Factorio, because they automate crafting for you. Building a bigger factory requires crafting a lot of parts and the machines to make those parts. Therefore automated crafting at large scales is the solution for getting everything done within reasonable time. Assembling machines are large electric powered crafting machines. They are accessed using inserters and they craft without stopping as long as they have the space and ingredients and power to keep working. 

tutorial-chapter-8-step-9-header=Setting up your first assembling machine
tutorial-chapter-8-step-9-detail=Craft an assembling machine and place it down. The first thing you need to do with it is to set its crafting recipe. Select the automation science pack, and then set up small electric poles to power the machine. The tier 1 assembling machine crafts half as fast as you and it requires exact ingredients to work rather than just raw materials, but you can build any number of them.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-10-header=Parallel crafting with assembling machines 
tutorial-chapter-8-step-10-detail=Now grab some copper plates and drop them into the assembling machine. Craft some iron gear wheels by hand and drop them into the machine too. Next, continue crafting iron gear wheels while the machine makes automation science packs for you. Therefore you are now crafting two things at once.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-11-header=Automate automation science packs: Place machines
tutorial-chapter-8-step-11-detail=Craft a second assembling machine and two inserters. Pick up your first assembling machine by mining it and then place it next to your lab with 1 tile of space. Place the other assembling machine next to the first 1 with again 1 tile of space in between. Configure the second machine to produce iron gear wheels and the first machine to produce automation science packs. 

tutorial-chapter-8-step-12-header=Automate automation science packs: Place inserters
tutorial-chapter-8-step-12-detail=Place one inserter between the two assemblers and another inserter between the science pack assembler and the lab. Rotate the inserters so that the gear assembler feeds the science pack assembler, which feeds the lab. Finally add electric poles and now you are done.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-13-header=Status review
tutorial-chapter-8-step-13-detail=You have a factory that converts metal plates into science! The next goal will be to fully automate your iron supply in an extendable way so that your science production can be fully automated from mine to lab.

#--Chapter 9-- Length: 13
tutorial-chapter-9-step-1-header=Chapter 9, Mass produce iron using belts
tutorial-chapter-9-step-1-detail=Chapter 9, Mass produce iron using belts

tutorial-chapter-9-step-2-header=Research "Logistics"
tutorial-chapter-9-step-2-detail=Select "Logistics" as the next technology to research. This will unlock underground belts, which allow moving short sections of transport belts underground so that they can avoid obstacles or other belts. It also unlocks belt splitters, which are useful machines that allow you to do things like splitting one belt into two belts with the contents divided equally. These machines will be very useful when you start using more belts later.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-3-header=Electric mining drills
tutorial-chapter-9-step-3-detail=While waiting for research, you can scale up your ore production by switching to electric mining drills. Craft 4 of them now. They are twice as fast as burner mining drills, and they can mine a wider area, and they are more energy efficient, and energizing them with electric poles is much easier than refeueling a drill using coal belts and inserters.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-4-header=Create an iron ore belt
tutorial-chapter-9-step-4-detail=Craft 15 transport belts and go to your iron ore patch. Face a direction that has empty space ahead, and place down the belts in a straight line, as before. 

tutorial-chapter-9-step-5-header=Place electric mining drills
tutorial-chapter-9-step-5-detail=Place your electric mining drills along both sides of this belt. They can be wall to wall or with up to 2 spaces in between while they maintain full coverage of the ore around them. Rotate them to face the belt. Then place electric poles around them to supply energy, with every small electric pole able to reach at most 2 drills. This completes the iron ore belt. 

tutorial-chapter-9-step-6-header=First furnace row: Check the space
tutorial-chapter-9-step-6-detail=Next comes mass smelting. Extend the iron ore belt into the empty space beyond the ore patch. Note that this space needs to be at least 10 tiles wide and at least 20 tiles long in order to make the system fit comfortably. You can estimate how much empty space is around you by moving to the middle of your empty space and running the scanner tool. If nearby objects are at least 10 tiles away, that generally means that you have empty space in every direction for at least 10 tiles, and you can easily fit a 10 by 10 factory area there, with you standing at the center point.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-7-header=First furnace row: Place furnaces
tutorial-chapter-9-step-7-detail=Craft 4 stone furnaces and use Cursor Mode to precisely place them in one row along the same side of the belt, with 1 tile of gap space in between each furnace and the belt, and 1 tile of gap space between each furnace and its neighbour. For the purpose of clarity, from now on the parts of the furnaces that face the belt can be considered as their front sides.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-8-header=First furnace row: Place input inserters
tutorial-chapter-9-step-8-detail=Craft 15 belts, 10 inserters and at least 3 electric poles. Place one inserter each in the gap between each furnace and the ore belt, so that inserters feed the fronts of the furnaces from the ore belt. 

tutorial-chapter-9-step-9-header=First furnace row: Place output inserters and belt
tutorial-chapter-9-step-9-detail=Next, place an inserter behind every furnace, to take iron plates out. Create a new transport belt parallel to the first one, but located behind the inserters at the back, so that the inserters will drop iron plates onto this new belt. 

tutorial-chapter-9-step-10-header=First furnace row: Place electric poles 
tutorial-chapter-9-step-10-detail=Now, place electric poles in between neighbouring furnaces so that all the inserters can be powered. In this case it is enough to place a pole in every second gap. You now have an extendable set up for smelting iron ore, except for the problem of refueling the furnaces.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-11-header=First furnace row: Extend the coal belt
tutorial-chapter-9-step-11-detail=You can refuel your row of furnaces by redirecting your iron ore patch's coal belt, since you will not be using the burner machines any more. Extend the belt to make it run directly next to the iron ore belt.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-12-header=First furnace row: Add long handed inserters
tutorial-chapter-9-step-12-detail=Craft 4 long handed inserters and place 1 next to every input inserter, facing the same direction. The long handed inserters take from 2 tiles ahead of them instead of 1 and drop 2 tiles behind instead of 1. In this case they will take from the coal belt and drop into the back sides of the furnaces, but building sides do not matter for any type of inserter interaction. Finally, you have a fully automated furnace row!

tutorial-chapter-9-step-13-header=Row output chests
tutorial-chapter-9-step-13-detail=Now that you are working with rows of machines and belts of items, it is useful to create collection points at the ends of the rows. This can be done by placing an inserter at the side of a belt at the end of the row, and placing a chest behind the inserter. These colleection points can be good fast travel points for collecting items. Consider setting up such an output chest for your furnace row.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-1-detail=Chapter 10, Complete the automation science pack factory

tutorial-chapter-10-step-2-header=Next you will automate copper
tutorial-chapter-10-step-2-detail=You now have an extendable iron plate supply, which is exactly what you need for a growing factory. You need something similar for copper as well, using the electric mining drill and furnace row arrangement just described. Set up the copper ore belt now.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-3-header=Splitting the coal belt
tutorial-chapter-10-step-3-detail=For your copper smelting area, you will need a new coal supply belt. You can create a new belt at your coal patch, but alternatively you can also split your coal supply belt into two using a splitter. Make sure the research of "Logistics" has been completed, and craft 1 splitter. 

tutorial-chapter-10-step-4-header=About splitters
tutorial-chapter-10-step-4-detail=A splitter is a transport belt system machine that is two tiles wide and 1 tile long. It can input two belts from its wide back and output two belts from its wide front, but its narrow sides have no belt access. The splitter works by taking from its input belts at equal speed and distributing to its output belts at equal speed. Therefore you can take one or two input belts, such as coal belts, and split them equally between two output belts.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-5-header=Select the splitting point
tutorial-chapter-10-step-5-detail=Select a point along your coal suppply belt where you want to split it in two. Consider the path a new coal supply belt from your coal patch would need to take to reach your copper patch, and consider how much of this path can overlap with the path you already have to the iron ore patch. The place where the two paths diverge is often the best place for the splitter.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-6-header=Place the splitter
tutorial-chapter-10-step-6-detail=Take the splitter in hand and rotate it to face the same direction as the belt on the ground. Move the cursor over the belt. You can either place the splitter here directly, or you can move it one tile to the side before placing it, depending on whether you want the new belt output to go to the left or the right of the existing belt. Placing the splitter will automatically put the replaced belt unit back into your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-7-header=Extend the coal belt
tutorial-chapter-10-step-7-detail=Place a belt unit in front of the empty output of the splitter, and your new coal supply belt is ready. Extend this belt until it reaches your planned copper smelting area. While building your new belt, your path might require crossing over obstacles such as another transport belt. This is where you can use underground belts. 

tutorial-chapter-10-step-8-header=About underground belts part 1
tutorial-chapter-10-step-8-detail=The underground belt item is actually the entrance chute for an underground belt segment. You rotate the item to face the same direction as the belt on the ground and place it down to create the entrance chute.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-9-header=About underground belts part 2
tutorial-chapter-10-step-9-detail=You can place another underground belt chute up to 4 tiles away. The chute needs to face the same direction as the entrance chute, and the preview will read whether it is connected. When you place a connected chute, the underground belt segment is created automatically between the two chutes and for free. The underground segment does not interact with anything including any other underground belt segments.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-10-header=Build the copper smelting row
tutorial-chapter-10-step-10-detail=Build your copper smelting furnace row with the same design as the iron smelthing furnace row.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-11-header=Extend your metal plate belts
tutorial-chapter-10-step-11-detail=When your copper smelting area is completed, next extend your iron plate belt and your copper plate belt to a new empty area where you can use rows of assembling machines to make iron gear wheels and automation science packs. Use underground belts if needed. This new area will need to be about 20 tiles wide and at least 30 tiles long.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-12-header=Place a row of assembling machines
tutorial-chapter-10-step-12-detail=Extend your two belts directly side by side across the middle of your new area. Place 6 assembling machines along one side with 1 tile of space in between the machines and the belt, and again 1 tile of space between neighbouring machines.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-13-header=Configure a row of assembling machines
tutorial-chapter-10-step-13-detail=Configure the first assembling machine in your row to make iron gear wheels. This machine will be fast enough by itself to supply up to 10 assembling machines making automation science packs. Configure the 5 other assembling machines to make the science packs. You can use the entity settings copy-paste shortcuts here, which were "__CONTROL__copy-entity-settings-info__" to copy and "__CONTROL__paste-entity-settings-info__" to paste.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-14-header=Place iron gear wheel inserters
tutorial-chapter-10-step-14-detail=Place an inserter to feed the iron gear wheel assembler with iron plates. You will need either a regular inserter or a long handed inserter, depending on how you arranged your belts. Behind the assembler, place a regular inserter for taking out the gear wheels. 

tutorial-chapter-10-step-15-header=Place the output belts
tutorial-chapter-10-step-15-detail=Craft transport belts, and starting from the iron gear wheel output inserter, create a new belt that runs along the back of the row of machines. This will be your iron gear wheel belt for supplying the science pack assemblers. Next, create a new belt parallel to the iron gear belt, and this one will be used to collect the finished science packs from the row.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-16-header=Complete the science pack assembling row
tutorial-chapter-10-step-16-detail=Place inserters and long handed inserters and power poles as necessary so that your machines are all working or full.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-17-header=About machine rows
tutorial-chapter-10-step-17-detail=You have now used all 4 easily accessible belts around this row of assembling machines but the row gets the job done. The row can be extended easily if you want a larger factory overall. Spaced out machine rows like these are the core concept of building extendable factory areas of any kind. You can create all kinds of rows like this, and learning about more techniques such as belt lanes will help you come up with different designs.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-18-header=Use the science packs
tutorial-chapter-10-step-18-detail=You can extend your science pack belt to go to a row of labs. With 5 science pack assemblers, you can easily run 5 to 10 labs continuously. You will need to extend your furnace rows and ore mining rows to feed your assembling machines. The overall factory size you want will depend on your target science research speed, but 5 automation science pack assemblers gives a fairly good speed. 

tutorial-chapter-10-step-19-header=The next steps 
tutorial-chapter-10-step-19-detail=With your power and basic research all ready to go, you are ready to keep exploring new technologies and growing the factory. In general, your goal should be to aim for the next science pack until you are ready to build the rocket silo. New systems, resources, and challenges will become available to you along the way.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-2-detail=You can hold "__CONTROL__pickup-items-info__"to pick up nearby items on the ground or on belts.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-3-header=Menu search
tutorial-chapter-11-step-3-detail=As you unlock more types of items and your menus become larger, it might be easier to find something in a menu using the menu search box. Press "__CONTROL__menu-search-open__" to open the search box and type in the item name and press "ENTER" to save the search term. You can then press "__CONTROL__menu-search-get-next__" to run the search on almost any menu. In some menus you can also search backwards by pressing "__CONTROL__menu-search-get-last__".

tutorial-chapter-11-step-4-header=Copy pasting machine settings
tutorial-chapter-11-step-4-detail=You can copy paste settings such as assembling machine recipes or building filters so that you do not hav configure them every time. You can copy the settings of a selected machine by pressing "__CONTROL__copy-entity-settings-info__" on it and paste the settings on another machine by pressing "__CONTROL__paste-entity-settings-info__" on it.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-5-header=Belt fullness reflects production issues
tutorial-chapter-11-step-5-detail=In general, if you aim to have more machines filling a belt than emptying it, you can expect the belt to usually be full. This is useful for identifying belts quickly, and also any empty belt would be a sign to indicate a production problem.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-6-header=Leave extra space
tutorial-chapter-11-step-6-detail=There is usually plenty of building space that you can find or create easily. Aim to leave at least 10 tiles of space between different production areas since you never know when you might need to pass a new belt through an area.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-7-header=Rebuilding is normal
tutorial-chapter-11-step-7-detail=It is a normal part of Factorio to pick up all the buildings in an area and build something new and better. This is a great solution when you are feeling stuck.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-8-header=Instant mining tool
tutorial-chapter-11-step-8-detail=You can clear a large number of buildings using the instant mining tool. Press "CONTROL + X" to take it in hand and press "__CONTROL__clear-cursor__" to remove it. In this mode every building the cursor touches is instantly mined. You can also instantly area mine every building within 10 tiles of the cursor by pressing "__CONTROL__mine-area__" while this tool is in hand. In contrast, area mining without the tool in hand will only target obstacles such as trees and rocks and items on the ground.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-9-header=Machines take only what they need
tutorial-chapter-11-step-9-detail=You may have noticed that inserters do not try to completely fill up building input slots. The rule they use is to gather enough input ingredients for two more crafting cycles but not more, so that the majority of materials can remain on the belt or in the chest in front of the inserter for other inserters to use. The same applies to inserters refueling machines, except for trains.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-10-header=Production has ratios
tutorial-chapter-11-step-10-detail=It is feasible to use any number of machines that you want for any task, but in general there are numerical limits and ratios to help guide things. For example, three assembling machines making copper cable are precisely enough for supplying two assembling machines making electronic circuits.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-11-header=Power management
tutorial-chapter-11-step-11-detail=It is a good idea to keep track of your power grid. Examining any electric pole will report how its power grid is doing. Low power will slow down machines but they will keep on working, although if your coal mining drills slow down too much they might not be able to catch up with the demand from your boilers and you will have to disconnect part of your factory until your coal supply is restored.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-12-header=Warnings menu
tutorial-chapter-11-step-12-detail=You can press "__CONTROL__open-warnings-menu__" to open the warnings menu. In addition to check machine statuses, this menu can identify some factory problems for you.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-13-header=Mall building
tutorial-chapter-11-step-13-detail=While producing science packs is the main goal of a factory, it is also a good idea to make the factory also produce items and buildings for you to use yourself, like assembling machines making assembling machines for you. You can dedicate some output chests or a design an area for this. The community likes to call these areas "malls" or "hubs".

tutorial-chapter-11-step-14-header=Lab chaining
tutorial-chapter-11-step-14-detail=Research labs have a handy feature where an inserter can take any science pack from one lab and put it in another. You can use this idea to make a simple chain of labs, where only the first one needs to be supplied from a belt or a chest.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-15-header=Chest slot locking
tutorial-chapter-11-step-15-detail=Chest inventories have a special feature where you can lock slots, starting from the last one and up until the first one, using "PAGE UP" or "PAGE DOWN". Locked slots can be emptied by inserters as usual, but they cannot be filled by inserters. Therefore you can limit how much a chest can be filled, and thus how much it drains your factory resources.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-16-header=Transport belt lanes
tutorial-chapter-11-step-16-detail=Transport belts have two lanes, and inserters prioritize the lanes using specific rules. When you split or merge or sideload belts, lanes interact in specific ways. You can safely ignore the lanes when you use only one type of item for each belt. Learning and using lane management later on can allow you to reliably transport two types of items on each belt instead of one, or to use the full capacity of a belt when high item traffic is needed.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-17-header=Check a building's  status
tutorial-chapter-11-step-17-detail=You can check a building's current status and some other stats like its health level by pressing "__CONTROL__read-entity-status__" on it. This will help with figuring out any issues with your production.

tutorial-chapter-11-step-18-header=Area scanning
tutorial-chapter-11-step-18-detail=Area scanning allows you to analyze a specific square area around your cursor. To use it, press "__CONTROL__toggle-cursor__" to toggle Cursor Mode and then press "__CONTROL__cursor-size-increment__" and "__CONTROL__cursor-size-decrement__" to change the cursor size. For cursor sizes greater than 1 the cursor reports all the found entities within its area. You can press "DIRECTION KEYS" to move the cursor by its size for each press and scan a new area every time, or you can press "ARROW KEYS" to move the cursor by only 1 tile at any cursor size.
