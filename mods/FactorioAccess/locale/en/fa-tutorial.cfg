# First step is always the chapter title

tutorial-chapter-1-step-2-header=Status report
tutorial-chapter-1-step-2-detail=You have survived the landing unharmed but your spaceship is completely wrecked. You will need to build a new rocket from scratch to get back to space. This will require plenty resources and specialized buildings to process them. But to do any of that, you first need to acquire some iron.
#Give rocket fuel here ****

tutorial-chapter-1-step-3-header=Walking around
tutorial-chapter-1-step-3-detail=You can walk around by pressing "W", "A", "S", "D", with "W" facing the north. When you press a new direction, you will only turn around on the first press. As you walk, the cursor system will identify the terrain or the entity in front of you.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-4-header=Coordinate system
tutorial-chapter-1-step-4-detail=The coordinate system has been established with your crash site at point 0,0. Walking East will increase the X coordinate and walking South will increase the Y coordinate. You can check your cursor coordinate by pressing "K". Using whole number coordinates, the world can be described as being divided into square tiles that are each about 1 meter in length.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-5-header=Cursor Mode
tutorial-chapter-1-step-5-detail=You can also use Cursor Mode, where your cursor moves around while you stand in place. This is useful for examining other objects behind an obstacle in front of you. Press "I" to toggle Cursor Mode, and press "J" to return the cursor back to you. Press "K" to read the cursor coordinates or press "SHIFT + K" to get the cursor's distance and direction from you.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-6-header=Entity scanner tool 1
tutorial-chapter-1-step-6-detail=To find objects further away, the entity scanner tool is essential. You can run a scan by pressing "END". This will index all nearby objects at the time of scanning, and they will be listed in terms of their types and their distances from your original scanning point. To explore the scan results list, press "PAGE UP" and "PAGE DOWN". You can also press "HOME" to reread the current scan list entry. Reading an entry will make your cursor jump to it.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-7-header=Entity scanner tool 2
tutorial-chapter-1-step-7-detail=Futhermore, you can hold "SHIFT" while pressing "PAGE UP" or "PAGE DOWN" to switch between different instances of the same entity. You can also filter the scan list to mention only a specific category of entities. Switch your filter categories by holding "CONTROL" while pressing "PAGE UP" or "PAGE DOWN". Take a moment to examine what is around. You can press "SHIFT + Y" to hear the description for the last indexed entity.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-8-header=Salvaging iron plates
tutorial-chapter-1-step-8-detail=It seems that some iron plates can be salvaged from inside the wreckage pieces of your spaceship. Your scanner is able to identify these wreckage pieces. You can walk over to them to access them or you can access objects that are up to 10 tiles away while in Cursor Mode. You can empty out a cursor selected entity by pressing "CONTROL + LEFT BRACKET".

tutorial-chapter-1-step-9-header=Finding iron ore
tutorial-chapter-1-step-9-detail=You still need more iron, and the good news is that there iron ore can be found in large patches across the surface. Locate the nearest iron ore patch by using the scanner tool. You can set the category to "Resources" to narrow down the search results. Head over to the resource patch.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-10-header=Smooth walking 
tutorial-chapter-1-step-10-detail=Press "CONTROL + W" to toggle smooth walking mode. In this mode you turn and start moving instantly. You are no longer locked to the coordinate grid and you run as long as the buttons stay pressed, including diagonal directions. The cursor does not read the terrain of tiles in this mode.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-11-header=Mining iron ore
tutorial-chapter-1-step-11-detail=You can mine an ore tile by holding down "X". This will take some time but you will get one of the several ore pieces of the tile. Mine a few pieces now.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-12-header=Ore needs to smelted
tutorial-chapter-1-step-12-detail=The ore needs to be smelted in a furnace for it to be usable. You should have a small furnace unit in your inventory, among the emergency equipment you grabbed while evacuation the ship.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-13-header=Inventory access
tutorial-chapter-1-step-13-detail=Press "E" to toggle your inventory. All the items you hold can be found here, except for equipped items. The inventory is a grid of 9 rows and 10 columns of slots for items. Items are kept in stacks, where multiple items can be added into the same slot until a stack size limit, which depends on the item.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-14-header=Inventory controls 1
tutorial-chapter-1-step-14-detail=Use the movement key to navigate inventory slots. When you go off the edge of the inventory, you wrap back around the other side. Selected items will be read. You can press "Y" to read the description for an item, press "K" to read the current inventory slot coordinates, and press "LEFT BRACKET" to take the item in hand.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-15-header=Grab your furnace
tutorial-chapter-1-step-15-detail=xFind the stone furnace in your inventory and take it in hand by pressing "LEFT BRACKET" and then press "E" to close the inventory. The item is now still in you hand, but out in the world.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-16-header=Building placement from hand
tutorial-chapter-1-step-16-detail=Because you have a buidling in hand, the cursor can now report extra preview information about trying to place the building at its location. You can press "SHIFT + Q" to review the item in hand, "Q" to empty the hand into your inventory, or press "LEFT BRACKET" to confirm and place the building. Place the furnace down somewhere on the ore patch.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-17-header=Building quick info and status checks.
tutorial-chapter-1-step-17-detail=The furnace is now on the ground. When you examine it you might notice that it reports being out of fuel or raw materials. These quick reports are good for checking a building instantly, but most buildings also report status information. You can check a building's status and some other stats by pressing "RIGHT BRACKET" on it.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-18-header=Building menus
tutorial-chapter-1-step-18-detail=To check inside a building, open its menu by pressing "LEFT BRACKET". This will open one of several building sectors, usually the output. You can switch between sectors using "TAB" and "SHIFT + TAB" and you can close the menu by pressing "E". One of the sectors is the player inventory, available for convenience but with fewer features than usual.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-19-header=Add ore to a furnace
tutorial-chapter-1-step-19-detail=To get the furnace working, you will need to add the iron ore and some fuel. From the player inventory sector you can grab the ore stack in hand and switch to the input sector and put in the stack by pressing "LEFT BRACKET". 

tutorial-chapter-1-step-20-header=Add fuel to a furnace
tutorial-chapter-1-step-20-detail=Next you should add some fuel. The rocket fuel you recovered from the ship can be used here and it will keep this furnace going for a long time. Just as with the ore, you can take it in hand from the inventory sector. In this case, it is better if you take only half of the fuel from the slot by pressing "RIGHT BRACKET", and place it into the fuel sector slot. One unit of fuel is moved into the smelting chamber when smelting begins and it is consumed as the furnace works. If the furnace is interruped, the fuel consumption also stops, so fuel is never wasted. The partially consumed fuel is lost only if you pick up the furnace.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-21-header=The furnace is working
tutorial-chapter-1-step-21-detail=The furnace is working now. You can collect iron plates from the output sector slot as they become ready one at a time. You will need to collect and add more ore to keep the furnace going, but you can let your mining drills do that for you.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-22-header=Mining drills
tutorial-chapter-1-step-22-detail=You had a fuel-powered burner mining drill as part of your emergency equipment. You can set up this mining drill in such a way that it directly mines and drops ore into the furnace. This is more easily done in Cursor Mode.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-23-header=Building in Cursor Mode
tutorial-chapter-1-step-23-detail=Open your inventory and grab the burner mining drill. Close the inventory by pressing "E" and then enable Cursor Mode by pressing "I". This will make the build preview move around with the cursor while you stand still.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-24-header=Precise drill placement
tutorial-chapter-1-step-24-detail= The drill in hand is a 2 by 2 building, like the furnace on the ground. In cursor mode, a building is always held by its northwest corner (or its top left corner). Place the drill somewhere on the ore patch such that it is fully aligned wall-to-wall with the stone furnace.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-25-header=Rotating mining drills
tutorial-chapter-1-step-25-detail=The drill is a building with a direction. It will drop mined ore from a chute at its side that faces the same direction as the drill. In this case the drill needs to face into the furnace. Press "R" or "SHIFT + R" on the drill to rotate it. Note that you can also rotate a building preview in hand, and some buildings, like furnaces, never need to be rotated.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-26-header=You will need more fuel
tutorial-chapter-1-step-26-detail=If you have any fuel left over you can add it to the drill now to get it working too, but both the drill and the furnace will run out of fuel soon. You are getting iron now but your next goal is to set up a reliable fuel supply.

#--Chapter 2-- Length: ?
tutorial-chapter-2-step-1-header=Chapter 2, Get coal and get crafting
tutorial-chapter-2-step-1-detail=Chapter 2, Get coal and get crafting

tutorial-chapter-2-step-2-header=Coal sources
tutorial-chapter-2-step-2-detail=Coal is an ideal fuel source. Like iron ore, it can be mined from patches by hand or by using drills. It can also be found inside huge rocks that can be found across the surface. The huge rocks also yield some stone. Meanwhile, big rocks yield only stone.

##teleports
#scan for huge rocks
#fast travel points
#teleporting to huge rocks

tutorial-chapter-2-step-3-header=Locate a huge rock
tutorial-chapter-2-step-3-detail=Use the scanner tool to locate a huge rock, which counts as a resource. To recap, you run a scan by pressing "END", navigate the list with "PAGE UP" and "PAGE DOWN", or "HOME" to repeat, and you can switch between instances when you hold "SHIFT" and you can switch between filter categories when you hold "CONTROL". There is a small chance that you do not find any rocks.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-4-header=Fast travel points
tutorial-chapter-2-step-4-detail=While you will go to the rock only once, you will want to visit the iron ore patch several times. Therefore it would be good to set up a fast travel point here. You can create and edit any number of named points on the map and fast travel to them by teleporting. Open the fast travel menu by pressing "V" and follow the instructions to create a point near the furnace.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-5-header=Teleporting
tutorial-chapter-2-step-5-detail=The teleporter is good for fast travel, but it can also be used at any time to teleport to the cursor location by pressing "SHIFT + T". When you combine this with the scan list moving the cursor to indexed entities, you can simply teleport to an indexed entity after finding it with the scanner.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-6-header=Mine a huge rock
tutorial-chapter-2-step-6-detail=Look for a huge rock using the scanner and then teleport or walk to it and mine it by holding "X". If you cannot locate any huge rocks, try big rocks instead, or else try coal patches.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-7-header=Gather coal and stone
tutorial-chapter-2-step-7-detail=Using any rocks you can find, aim to gather at least 50 coal and 50 stone, which is one stack each for these items. If you can only find ore patches, aim to mine by hand until you have 20 coal and 40 stone.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-8-header=Refuel buildings and collect iron plates
tutorial-chapter-2-step-8-detail=Use the fast travel menu to return to your furnace and miner and collect iron plates from the furnace output sector. If either of them are out of fuel, take half of a coal stack from the inventory using "RIGHT BRACKET" and place it into the fuel sector slot.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-9-header=First crafting goals
tutorial-chapter-2-step-9-detail=To get a steady coal supply and an improved supply of iron, it would be much nicer to have more drills and furnaces working for you, and now you have the raw materials for crafting them.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-10-header=Crafting menu
tutorial-chapter-2-step-10-detail=Press "E" to open the player inventory menu, which is the main character menu. Press "TAB" to switch to the crafting menu. This menu lets you browse the crafting recipe list. Items are grouped into four categories: logistics, production, intermediate products, and combat. You can switch category by pressing "W" or "S" and you can navigate within a category by pressing "A" or "D". Find stone furnaces in the "production" category and craft two by pressing "LEFT BRACKET" twice. When crafting is complete, the items appear in your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-11-header=Crafting takes ready ingredients
tutorial-chapter-2-step-11-detail=In the crafting menu, find burner mining drills within the "production" category. Press "K" to check the ingredients needed. Note that it includes stone furnaces that you already crafted and iron gear wheels that you do not have. Press "RIGHT BRACKET" to craft 5 burner mining drills in one key press. The crafting queue will take the furnaces you already have, and it will also take iron plates and stone pieces to make the ***
