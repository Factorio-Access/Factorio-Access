tutorial-chapter-1-step-1-header=Chapter 1, Welcome to Nauvis, you need iron
tutorial-chapter-1-step-1-detail=Chapter 1, Welcome to Nauvis, you need iron
# First step is always the chapter title

tutorial-chapter-1-step-2-header=Status report
tutorial-chapter-1-step-2-detail=You have survived the landing unharmed but your spaceship is completely wrecked. You will need to build a new rocket from scratch to get back to space. This will require plenty resources and specialized buildings to process them. But to do any of that, you first need to acquire some iron.
#Give rocket fuel here ****

tutorial-chapter-1-step-3-header=Walking around
tutorial-chapter-1-step-3-detail=You can walk around by pressing "W", "A", "S", "D", with "W" facing the north. When you press a new direction, you will only turn around on the first press. As you walk, the cursor system will identify the terrain or the entity in front of you.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-4-header=Coordinate system
tutorial-chapter-1-step-4-detail=The coordinate system has been established with your crash site at point 0,0. Walking East will increase the X coordinate and walking South will increase the Y coordinate. You can check your cursor coordinate by pressing "K". Using whole number coordinates, the world can be described as being divided into square tiles that are each about 1 meter in length.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-5-header=Cursor Mode
tutorial-chapter-1-step-5-detail=You can also use Cursor Mode, where your cursor moves around while you stand in place. This is useful for examining other objects behind an obstacle in front of you. Press "I" to toggle Cursor Mode, and press "J" to return the cursor back to you. Press "K" to read the cursor coordinates or press "SHIFT + K" to get the cursor's distance and direction from you.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-6-header=Entity scanner tool 1
tutorial-chapter-1-step-6-detail=To find objects further away, the entity scanner tool is essential. You can run a scan by pressing "END". This will index all nearby objects at the time of scanning, and they will be listed in terms of their types and their distances from your original scanning point. To explore the scan results list, press "PAGE UP" and "PAGE DOWN". You can also press "HOME" to reread the current scan list entry. Reading an entry will make your cursor jump to it.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-7-header=Entity scanner tool 2
tutorial-chapter-1-step-7-detail=Futhermore, you can hold "SHIFT" while pressing "PAGE UP" or "PAGE DOWN" to switch between different instances of the same entity. You can also filter the scan list to mention only a specific category of entities. Switch your filter categories by holding "CONTROL" while pressing "PAGE UP" or "PAGE DOWN". Take a moment to examine what is around. You can press "SHIFT + Y" to hear the description for the last indexed entity.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-8-header=Salvaging iron plates
tutorial-chapter-1-step-8-detail=It seems that some iron plates can be salvaged from inside the wreckage pieces of your spaceship. Your scanner is able to identify these wreckage pieces. You can walk over to them to access them or you can access objects that are up to 10 tiles away while in Cursor Mode. You can empty out a cursor selected entity by pressing "CONTROL + LEFT BRACKET".

tutorial-chapter-1-step-9-header=Finding iron ore
tutorial-chapter-1-step-9-detail=You still need more iron, and the good news is that there iron ore can be found in large patches across the surface. Locate the nearest iron ore patch by using the scanner tool. You can set the category to "Resources" to narrow down the search results. Head over to the resource patch.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-10-header=Smooth walking 
tutorial-chapter-1-step-10-detail=Press "CONTROL + W" to toggle smooth walking mode. In this mode you turn and start moving instantly. You are no longer locked to the coordinate grid and you run as long as the buttons stay pressed, including diagonal directions. The cursor does not read the terrain of tiles in this mode.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-11-header=Mining iron ore
tutorial-chapter-1-step-11-detail=You can mine an ore tile by holding down "X". This will take some time but you will get one of the several ore pieces of the tile. Mine a few pieces now.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-12-header=Ore needs to smelted
tutorial-chapter-1-step-12-detail=The ore needs to be smelted in a furnace for it to be usable. You should have a small furnace unit in your inventory, among the emergency equipment you grabbed while evacuation the ship.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-13-header=Inventory access
tutorial-chapter-1-step-13-detail=Press "E" to toggle your inventory. All the items you hold can be found here, except for equipped items. The inventory is a grid of 9 rows and 10 columns of slots for items. Items are kept in stacks, where multiple items can be added into the same slot until a stack size limit, which depends on the item.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-14-header=Inventory controls 1
tutorial-chapter-1-step-14-detail=Use the movement key to navigate inventory slots. When you go off the edge of the inventory, you wrap back around the other side. Selected items will be read. You can press "Y" to read the description for an item, press "K" to read the current inventory slot coordinates, and press "LEFT BRACKET" to take the item in hand.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-15-header=Grab your furnace
tutorial-chapter-1-step-15-detail=xFind the stone furnace in your inventory and take it in hand by pressing "LEFT BRACKET" and then press "E" to close the inventory. The item is now still in you hand, but out in the world.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-16-header=Building placement from hand
tutorial-chapter-1-step-16-detail=Because you have a buidling in hand, the cursor can now report extra preview information about trying to place the building at its location. You can press "SHIFT + Q" to review the item in hand, "Q" to empty the hand into your inventory, or press "LEFT BRACKET" to confirm and place the building. Place the furnace down somewhere on the ore patch.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-17-header=Building quick info and status checks.
tutorial-chapter-1-step-17-detail=The furnace is now on the ground. When you examine it you might notice that it reports being out of fuel or raw materials. These quick reports are good for checking a building instantly, but most buildings also report status information. You can check a building's status and some other stats by pressing "RIGHT BRACKET" on it.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-18-header=Building menus
tutorial-chapter-1-step-18-detail=To check inside a building, open its menu by pressing "LEFT BRACKET". This will open one of several building sectors, usually the output. You can switch between sectors using "TAB" and "SHIFT + TAB" and you can close the menu by pressing "E". One of the sectors is the player inventory, available for convenience but with fewer features than usual.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-19-header=Add ore to a furnace
tutorial-chapter-1-step-19-detail=To get the furnace working, you will need to add the iron ore and some fuel. From the player inventory sector you can grab the ore stack in hand and switch to the input sector and put in the stack by pressing "LEFT BRACKET". 

tutorial-chapter-1-step-20-header=Add fuel to a furnace
tutorial-chapter-1-step-20-detail=Next you should add some fuel. The rocket fuel you recovered from the ship can be used here and it will keep this furnace going for a long time. Just as with the ore, you can take it in hand from the inventory sector. In this case, it is better if you take only half of the fuel from the slot by pressing "RIGHT BRACKET", and place it into the fuel sector slot. One unit of fuel is moved into the smelting chamber when smelting begins and it is consumed as the furnace works. If the furnace is interruped, the fuel consumption also stops, so fuel is never wasted. The partially consumed fuel is lost only if you pick up the furnace.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-21-header=The furnace is working
tutorial-chapter-1-step-21-detail=The furnace is working now. You can collect iron plates from the output sector slot as they become ready one at a time. You will need to collect and add more ore to keep the furnace going, but you can let your mining drills do that for you.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-22-header=Mining drills
tutorial-chapter-1-step-22-detail=You had a fuel-powered burner mining drill as part of your emergency equipment. You can set up this mining drill in such a way that it directly mines and drops ore into the furnace. This is more easily done in Cursor Mode.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-23-header=Building in Cursor Mode
tutorial-chapter-1-step-23-detail=Open your inventory and grab the burner mining drill. Close the inventory by pressing "E" and then enable Cursor Mode by pressing "I". This will make the build preview move around with the cursor while you stand still.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-24-header=Precise drill placement
tutorial-chapter-1-step-24-detail= The drill in hand is a 2 by 2 building, like the furnace on the ground. In cursor mode, a building is always held by its northwest corner (or its top left corner). Place the drill somewhere on the ore patch such that it is fully aligned wall-to-wall with the stone furnace.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-25-header=Rotating mining drills
tutorial-chapter-1-step-25-detail=The drill is a building with a direction. It will drop mined ore from a chute at its side that faces the same direction as the drill. In this case the drill needs to face into the furnace. Press "R" or "SHIFT + R" on the drill to rotate it. Note that you can also rotate a building preview in hand, and some buildings, like furnaces, never need to be rotated.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-26-header=You will need more fuel
tutorial-chapter-1-step-26-detail=If you have any fuel left over you can add it to the drill now to get it working too, but both the drill and the furnace will run out of fuel soon. You are getting iron now but your next goal is to set up a reliable fuel supply.


#--Chapter 2-- Length: ?
tutorial-chapter-2-step-1-header=Chapter 2, Get coal and get crafting
tutorial-chapter-2-step-1-detail=Chapter 2, Get coal and get crafting

tutorial-chapter-2-step-2-header=Coal sources
tutorial-chapter-2-step-2-detail=Coal is an ideal fuel source. Like iron ore, it can be mined from patches by hand or by using drills. It can also be found inside huge rocks that can be found across the surface. The huge rocks also yield some stone. Meanwhile, big rocks yield only stone.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-3-header=Locate a huge rock
tutorial-chapter-2-step-3-detail=Use the scanner tool to locate a huge rock, which counts as a resource. To recap, you run a scan by pressing "END", navigate the list with "PAGE UP" and "PAGE DOWN", or "HOME" to repeat, and you can switch between instances when you hold "SHIFT" and you can switch between filter categories when you hold "CONTROL". There is a small chance that you do not find any rocks.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-4-header=Fast travel points
tutorial-chapter-2-step-4-detail=While you will go to the rock only once, you will want to visit the iron ore patch several times. Therefore it would be good to set up a fast travel point here. You can create and edit any number of named points on the map and fast travel to them by teleporting. Open the fast travel menu by pressing "V" and follow the instructions to create a point near the furnace.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-5-header=Teleporting
tutorial-chapter-2-step-5-detail=The teleporter is good for fast travel, but it can also be used at any time to teleport to the cursor location by pressing "SHIFT + T". When you combine this with the scan list moving the cursor to indexed entities, you can simply teleport to an indexed entity after finding it with the scanner.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-6-header=Mine a huge rock
tutorial-chapter-2-step-6-detail=Look for a huge rock using the scanner and then teleport or walk to it and mine it by holding "X". If you cannot locate any huge rocks, try big rocks instead, or else try coal patches.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-7-header=Gather coal and stone
tutorial-chapter-2-step-7-detail=Using any rocks you can find, aim to gather at least 50 coal and 50 stone, which is one stack each for these items. If you can only find ore patches, aim to mine by hand until you have 20 coal and 40 stone.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-8-header=Refuel buildings and collect iron plates
tutorial-chapter-2-step-8-detail=Use the fast travel menu to return to your furnace and miner and collect iron plates from the furnace output sector. If either of them are out of fuel, take half of a coal stack from the inventory using "RIGHT BRACKET" and place it into the fuel sector slot. If there is rocket fuel left, you can click on it ("LEFT BRACKET") with the coal stack in hand in order to swap the stacks and hold the rocket fuel instead.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-9-header=First crafting goals
tutorial-chapter-2-step-9-detail=To get a steady coal supply and an improved supply of iron, it would be much nicer to have more drills and furnaces working for you, and now you have the raw materials for crafting them.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-10-header=Crafting menu
tutorial-chapter-2-step-10-detail=Press "E" to open the player inventory menu, which is the main character menu. Press "TAB" to switch to the crafting menu. This menu lets you browse the crafting recipe list. Items are grouped into four categories: logistics, production, intermediate products, and combat. You can switch category by pressing "W" or "S" and you can navigate within a category by pressing "A" or "D". Find stone furnaces in the "production" category and craft a furnace by pressing "LEFT BRACKET". When crafting is complete, the items appear in your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-11-header=Crafting in bulk
tutorial-chapter-2-step-11-detail=Craft six more furnaces so that you have seven in total. You can press "RIGHT BRACKET" on a recipe to craft it 5 times instead of 1 time.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-12-header=Crafting mining drills using existing furnaces
tutorial-chapter-2-step-12-detail=Next in the crafting menu, find burner mining drills within the "production" category. Press "K" to check the ingredients needed. Note that it includes stone furnaces that you already crafted, and iron gear wheels that you do not have. Press "RIGHT BRACKET" to craft 5 burner mining drills in one key press. The crafting queue will take the furnaces you already have, and it will also automatically take iron plates and make gear wheels before making the drills.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-13-header=Self-feeding coal supply 1
tutorial-chapter-2-step-13-detail=Now that you have extra mining drills, you can use some to mine coal. Head over to the coal patch and place down a drill near the middle.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-14-header=Self-feeding coal supply 2
tutorial-chapter-2-step-14-detail=Now use cursor mode to place down a second mining drill aligned wall to wall with the first. Then rotate both drills to face each other. Because they are both mining coal, the drills will output into each other's fuel slots and keep each other running as long as there is space to drop the coal. You can then collect the coal from both at any time. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-15-header=Start smelting copper
tutorial-chapter-2-step-15-detail=With iron and coal solved for now, we can move onto other resources like copper. You will need a fair amount of copper later on so it is a good idea to set up one drill feeding one furnace at the nearest copper ore patch. Use the same arrangements as before for iron and perhaps set up fast travel points for each area.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-16-header=Find trees with area scanning
tutorial-chapter-2-step-16-detail=Your next required resource is wood. You can locate forests from the scanner tool and chop down trees to get wood. Trees do not grow back but you do not need that much wood anyway. Travel over to the nearest forest now. Within a forest, trees are nearby but not necessarily easy to find. You can use Cursor Mode to find them, especially using Area Scanning Mode. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-17-header=Area scanning
tutorial-chapter-2-step-17-detail=To use area scanning, press "I" to toggle Cursor Mode. You can then press "SHIFT + I" and "CONTROL + I" to change the cursor size. For cursor sizes greater than 1 the cursor reports all the found entities within its area. Use this to find trees. You can press direction keys to move the cursor by its size for each press, or you can press ARROW KEYS to move the cursor by only 1 tile at any size. You can then press "SHIFT + K" to get the relative position of the cursor box's left top corner and walk over to it.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-18-header=Area mining
tutorial-chapter-2-step-18-detail=A faster alternative method for clearing trees and also rocks is area mining. When youı press "SHIFT + X" on a tree or a rock or an empty tile, this will quickly mine all such entities within 10 tiles of the cursor tile. This is especially useful when these entities are obstructing you from building in an area.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-19-header=Start mining stone
tutorial-chapter-2-step-19-detail=When you have at least one stack of wood , you can move onto automating your stone supply using a mining drill and a chest. Place down a mining drill in the middle of the stone patch as usual and craft 1 wooden chest from the logistics category. Stone can be smelted into stone bricks but it is also needed in its raw form for crafting more furnaces, so we will collect it in a chest instead.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-20-header=Chests
tutorial-chapter-2-step-20-detail=Chests are useful because they have many output slots instead of one and mining drills can drop directly into them. Use Cursor Mode with the wooden chest in hand to find the correct corner of the mining drill that has the output chute. Place the chest directly in front of this chute and add some coal to the mining drill to get the stone supply going. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-21-header=Scaling up
tutorial-chapter-2-step-21-detail=Now you have prepared at least one machine that produces coal, iron plates, copper plates, and raw stone. You can consider this as your first factory, ready to help you make a bigger and better factory. Your next step along this journey should be to set up more pairs of iron miners and furnaces, because you will still need stacks and stacks full of iron. Aim to set up 5 iron furnaces, and consider using some of the following shortcuts along the way.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-22-header=Quickbar shortcuts
tutorial-chapter-2-step-22-detail=The quickbar is a system for you assign shortcut numbers to instantly get items from your inventory. It is very useful to do this for coal and furnaces. To set up a quickbar slot for an item, take it in hand or select from the inventory and press "CONTROL + DIGIT" where the digit could be between 0 and 9 from the keyboard. If you press the same "DIGIT" again, you will now grab that assigned item from your inventory to your hand. You can also use up to 10 different quickbars, although 1 quickbar is enough for now. You select a different quickbar by pressing "SHIFT + DIGIT" with the digit for your desired quickbar.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-23-header=Smart pipette tool shortcut
tutorial-chapter-2-step-23-detail=The smart pipette tool, or the picker tool, is another shortcut for grabbing items from your inventory. When you select an entity with the cursor, such as a building in front of you, press "Q" to use the smart pipette. It will grab from you inventory the item form of this entity if you have it. Otherwise it will do nothing. For ore on the ground, this tool has an additional shortcut that makes you grab a mining drill instead of ore from your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-24-header=Smart inserting between inventories
tutorial-chapter-2-step-24-detail=When working with building menus, when you select an item slot, you can press "SHIFT + LEFT BRACKET" to have the selected item stack instantly transfered into the most appropriate sector of the other building. You can use this shortcut to instantly insert ore and coal from your inventory into the correct slot of a furnace.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-25-header=Smart inserting from the open world.
tutorial-chapter-2-step-25-detail=Smart inserting also works in the open world with an item in hand. If you take coal in hand, like from the quickbar, and then position your cursor over a building such as a drill, you can press "Z" to smart insert 1 unit from the hand stack into the building. You can also press "CONTROL + RIGHT BRACKET" to smart insert half of the hand stack, or "CONTROL + LEFT BRACKET" to smart insert the whole hand stack. If your inventory has more of the same item in hand, the hand is immediately refilled from the inventory after you do smart inserting.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-26-header=Smart collecting from buildings
tutorial-chapter-2-step-26-detail=If your hand is empty, you can smart collect all the output you can from a cursor selected building by pressing "CONTROL + LEFT BRACKET". You can also collect just half of the total output by pressing "CONTROL + RIGHT BRACKET".

tutorial-chapter-2-step-27-header=Scale up check
tutorial-chapter-2-step-27-detail=Using the shortcuts described earlier, make sure you have 5 furnaces making iron plates. You will then have enough production for the next phase.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-28-header=Belts and inserters
tutorial-chapter-2-step-28-detail=As you may have realized, it has started to become quite an effort to carry coal from the source to all the machines that need it. It is also annoying that the coal mining drills have only one slot each while it would be nice to drop into chests. Since you have a good iron supply now, you can build machines to carry coal for you both in and out of machines and across the land. The machines you need are transport belts and burner inserters.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-29-header=Coal supply belt 1: Crafting
tutorial-chapter-2-step-29-detail=To set up a smarter coal supply using a transport belt system, first craft 15 transport belt units and 10 burner inserters from the logistics category. Also craft at least 1 burner mining drill.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-30-header=Coal supply belt 2: Place belts
tutorial-chapter-2-step-30-detail=Go to the middle of the coal ore patch and use the scanner to find the general direction of your iron ore patch. Let's say it is at the Northwest. In that case face the north. Take a transport belt stack in hand and rotate the stack to also face the same direction as you. Then build 1 belt unit and move forward 1 tile onto the belt and then build 1 more belt unit. Repeat this until all 10 belts are placed in a row and all face the connected direction to make a long belt. Transport belts do not require any energy sources, so this part of the system is finished.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-31-header=Coal supply belt 3: Place drills
tutorial-chapter-2-step-31-detail=Now you can place the four burner mining drills along the side of the transport belt. Make sure that you have 2 tiles of empty space between neighboring drills and make sure all the drills face the belt. Burner mining drills can drop directly onto belts as well so these drills will be supplying this coal supply belt.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-32-header=Coal supply belt 4: About burner inserters
tutorial-chapter-2-step-32-detail=Now we want to continue to make the drills supply themselves. Burner inserters can be used for this. An inserter is a machine that can smart collect an item from any building that is directly in front of it and then smart insert the item into any suitible building that is directly behind it. Burner inserters work using fuels, and they can directly use the coal from their own hands to keep themselves fueled. Regular inserters do not need fuel but they need electric power, which we will set up later.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-33-header=Coal supply belt 5: Place burner inserters
tutorial-chapter-2-step-33-detail=Based on the above explanation, you can place 1 burner inserter along the belt, with 1 tile of space between this inserter and a nearby burner mining drill. When you rotate the burner inserter to face the belt, it can take coal from the belt and put it on the ground behind it. Next, a second burner inserter needs to be place in between the coal on the ground and the burner mining drill. When this inserter faces the coal on the ground, it can take from that spot and feed the mining drill. Therefore we have a system where the drill drops coal onto the belt and the inserters use some of that coal to feed themselves and the mining drill, while the rest of the coal is free to travel along the belt to other places. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-34-header=Coal supply belt 6: Extend it
tutorial-chapter-2-step-34-detail=Repeat the pattern described earlier to place more inserters and burner mining drills along the coal belt. You can now craft more transport belts and extend this coal belt further towards the iron ore patch. At the end of the belt you can put a final inserter and make it feed a wooden chest. This will make sure that you always have a large amount of coal being filled into your chest at your iron ore area.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-35-header=The next phase
tutorial-chapter-2-step-35-detail=Now you have a steady supply of resources, especially iron. Using belts and inserters, you also have a smart coal supply to make it much easier to refuel all your iron production machines. You are now ready to do even more automation and prepare to begin research for higher technology. This will first require setting up a steam power system.


#--Chapter 3-- Length: ?
tutorial-chapter-3-step-1-header=Chapter 3, Water and power
tutorial-chapter-3-step-1-detail=Chapter 3, Water and power

tutorial-chapter-3-step-2-header=Craft an offshore pump and pipes
tutorial-chapter-3-step-2-detail=Steam power requires a constant water supply, so water will need to be transported to the base area. To do this, craft one offshore pump and at least 10 pipes. The pipe will need to go from the nearest water source over to near the coal patch.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-3-header=Go to water
tutorial-chapter-3-step-3-detail=Use the scanner tool to locate the nearest water body. Water can be found in lakes similar to ore patches, but they can be a lot larger and it cannot be walked on.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-header=Place the offshore pump.
tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-detail=Take the offshore pump from your inventory and press left click to run its special building assistant. The assistance will suggest good positions for placing the pump and the first suggestion is usually the nearest good position. Press "LEFT BRACKET" to confirm this. The offshore pump when set up will fill up with water instantly. It does not need any energy source so it is ready.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-5-header=Starting the water pipe
tutorial-chapter-3-step-5-detail=You can now take a stack of pipes in hand for transporting the water. Use Cursor Mode and maybe the scanner to locate the pump and then bring the cursor to the tile just next to the pump's exti. Press "LEFT BRACKET" to put down a pipe. If it is positioned correctly, the pipe will be full of water. Otherwise it will be empty.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-6-header=Extending the water pipe
tutorial-chapter-3-step-6-detail=Pipes will automatically connect to any neighboring pipes in any of the four main directions. Therefore you can put down more pipes along the first one to make an extended water pipe. You can also walk over this pipe. Use the scanner tool to locate the coal patch and extend the pipe towards it. You may need to use a lot of iron for this. Make the water pipe finish at an empty area that is about 10 tiles from the edge of the coal patch.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-7-header=Crafting steam power parts
tutorial-chapter-3-step-7-detail=Now that you have a water supply, you can craft the buildings needed for steam power. Craft 1 boiler and 2 steam engines using iron plates and stone furnaces. You also need copper and wood now, because you should also craft 1 (regular electric) inserter and at least 1 small power pole.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-8-header=Placing the boiler
tutorial-chapter-3-step-8-detail=First place down the boiler using Cursor Mode. The boiler is a 3 by 2 building that has a water pipe along its back and a steam output pipe on its front center. When the boiler is facing north, the water pipe ends are on its southeast and southwest corners, and its steam output is on the middle of its north side. You will want the boiler's back pipe to align exactly with the water pipe's end. You may need to rotate the boiler in hand to do this. If you do this correctly, the boiler will fill with water, and you can check the building to find this out. Place some coal in the boiler now to hear it start working and check if it has any steam in it.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-9-header=Nudging buildings
tutorial-chapter-3-step-9-detail=To align buildings that you already placed down, you can nudge them by one tile at a time. This is done by pressing "CONTROL + SHIFT + DIRECTION KEY", where the direction key is "W" or "A" or "S" or "D". A nudged building can only be nudged into an empty spot. You can use this feature to make sure that the boiler is aligned correctly.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-10-header=About the steam engine
tutorial-chapter-3-step-10-detail=The steam engine is a long building that is 3 by 5 tiles. Both of its short 3 tile sides provide access to a steam pipe that runs through the building and can move steam both in and out of the building. Take the steam engine in hand and enable Cursor Mode.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-11-header=Placing the steam engine 1
tutorial-chapter-3-step-11-detail=To precisely place the steam engine, first make sure that the area in front of the boiler is clear for building. Then rotate the steam engine to face the same direction as the boiler. Next, bring the cursor to overlap with the part of the boiler that has the steam output. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-12-header=Placing the steam engine 2
tutorial-chapter-3-step-12-detail=If the boiler is facing north, you now need to move 5 tiles north so that length of the steam engine is covered and the other end is near the boiler output. If the boiler is facing south, you move just 1 tile south so that your end of the engine is near the boiler output. Similarly, you need to move 5 tiles if the boiler is facing west, or just 1 tile if it is facing east. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-13-header=Placing the steam engine 3
tutorial-chapter-3-step-13-detail=Next, you need to move the cursor 1 tile sideways so that the middle of the three-tiles-wide boiler and the middle of the three-tiles-wide steam engine are correctly aligned. If the alignment is correct, the steam engine will now fill with steam from the boiler, and you can check the machine to verify this. One boiler can support two steam engines, so you can place your second steam engine at the other end of the first one using the same aligning technique. Use nudging if needed.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-14-header=Running and testing your steam power system
tutorial-chapter-3-step-14-detail=Now that your boilers and engines are set up, you can test if it works by giving it a load. Place a small electric pole next to each steam engine to create your electric grid. Place your third small electric pole next to the boiler, along its empty wide side, and finally place the electric inserter next the pole and the boiler. This will make your steam engines start to work at very low speed.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-15-header=Automated boiler fueling
tutorial-chapter-3-step-15-detail=Rotate the inserter that you just placed to face away from the boiler. If you place a chest of coal or a belt of coal in front of this inserter, it can be used to keep the boiler constantly fueled so that your power supply is continuous. Boilers and steam engines work smartly like furnaces such that they never waste any fuel or steam when there is a low power demand.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-16-header=Ready for labs
tutorial-chapter-3-step-16-detail=With your steam power system ready to go, you are finally ready to start using research labs so that you can build more advanced buildings and systems on your way to building a rocket.


#--Chapter 4-- Length: ?
tutorial-chapter-4-step-1-header=Chapter 4, Research and automation
tutorial-chapter-4-step-1-detail=Chapter 4, Research and automation

tutorial-chapter-4-step-2-header=Craft 1 research lab
tutorial-chapter-4-step-2-detail=Craft 1 research lab and place it somewhere between your iron ore patch and your steam engines.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-3-header=Power the lab
tutorial-chapter-4-step-3-detail=Place a small electric pole near your power network so that you can extend it. Keep extending it towards your lab so that it has power.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-4-header=About research packs
tutorial-chapter-4-step-4-detail=Open the lab to examine its input slots. As revealed here, research is done by consuming science packs and electric power at your labs to do experiments. Therefore the main items you need to produce throughout the game are the different types of research packs.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-5-header=Craft 10 automation science packs
tutorial-chapter-4-step-5-detail=Craft 10 automation science packs. You will need copper plates and iron gear wheels for this. Place the packs into the lab. The filled and powered lab will begin working when you select a technology to research.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-6-header=Select to research automation
tutorial-chapter-4-step-6-detail= Open the technology menu by pressing "E" to open the inventory and pressing "TAB" multiple times. In this menu, technologies are sorted according to whether they are already researched, available now for research, or locked due to prerequisites. You can change technology categories with "W" and "S" and you can navigate within a category with "A" and "D". Select the technology named "Automation" and press "Y" to read about it, press "K" to read its science pack requirements, and press "LEFT BRACKET" to start researching it.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-7-header=Research ongoing
tutorial-chapter-4-step-7-detail=You can hear the electricity crackle as a lab works. You can check the planet's local time and current research progress by pressing "T". You will hear the notification sound when the research is complete. Research progress is permanent such that you can interrupt one research to start another and then return to the first one and continue it from where it was left off.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-8-header=About assembling machines
tutorial-chapter-4-step-8-detail=Researching "automation" as unlocked the recipe for assembling machines, which are at the heart of Factorio, because they automate crafting for you. Building a bigger factory requires crafting a lot of parts and the machines to make those parts. Therefore, automated crafting at large scales is the solution for getting everything done within reasonable time. Assembling machines are 3 by 3 electric powered crafting machines that do not have special directions. They are accessed using inserters and they craft without stopping as long as they have the space and ingredients and power to keep working. The tier 1 assembling machine crafts half as fast as you and it requires exact ingredients to work rather than just raw materials, but you can build any number of them.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-9-header=Setting up your first assembling machine
tutorial-chapter-4-step-9-detail=Craft an assembling machine and place it down. The first thing you need to do with it is to set its crafting recipe. Select the automation science pack.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-10-header=Parallel crafting
tutorial-chapter-4-step-10-detail=Now grab some copper plates and drop them into the assembling machine. Craft some iron gear wheels by hand and drop them into the machine too. Next, continue crafting iron gear wheels while the machine makes automation science packs for you. Therefore you are now crafting two things at once.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-11-header=Automated automation science packs 1
tutorial-chapter-4-step-11-detail=Craft a second assembling machine and two inserters. Pick up your first assembling machine by mining it and then place it next to your lab with 1 tile of space. Place the other assembling machine next to the first 1 with again 1 tile of space. Configure the second machine to produce iron gear wheels and the first machine to produce automation science packs. 

tutorial-chapter-4-step-12-header=Automated automation science packs 2
tutorial-chapter-4-step-12-detail=Place one inserter between the two assemblers and another inserter between the science pack assembler and the lab. Finally add electric poles, and you are done. Rotate the inserters so that the gear assembler feeds the science pack assembler, which feeds the lab. Finally add electric poles and now you are done, you have a factory that converts metal plates into science!

tutorial-chapter-4-step-13-header=Research "logistics"
tutorial-chapter-4-step-13-detail=Select "logistics" as the next technology to research. This will unlock underground belts, which allow moving short sections of transport belts underground so that they can avoid obstacles or other belts. It also unlocks belt splitters, which are useful machines that allow you to do things like splitting one belt into two belts with the contents divided equally. These machines will be very useful when you start using more belts later.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-14-header=Electric mining drills
tutorial-chapter-4-step-14-detail=To better scale up your ore production, you can switch to electric mining drills. Craft 4 of them now. They are twice as fast as burner mining drills, and they can mine a wider area, and they are more energy efficient, and energizing them with electric poles is much easier than refeueling a drill using coal belts and inserters.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-15-header=Ore mining with belts
tutorial-chapter-4-step-15-detail=Craft 15 transport belts and go to your iron ore patch. Face a direction that has empty space ahead, and place down the belts in a straight line. Place your mining drills along both sides of this belt, rotate them to face the belt, and place power poles around them. You can now mass produce iron ore. 

tutorial-chapter-4-step-16-header=First furnace row 1
tutorial-chapter-4-step-16-detail=Next comes mass smelting. Extend the iron ore belt into the empty space. Craft 5 stone furnaces and place them in one row along the same side of the belt, with 1 tile of gap space in between each furnace and the belt, and 1 tile of gap space between each furnace and its neighbour. For the purpose of clarity, from now on the parts of the furnaces that face the belt can be considered as their front sides, although directions do not matter for furnaces to work.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-17-header=First furnace row 2
tutorial-chapter-4-step-17-detail=Craft 15 belts, 10 inserters and at least 3 electric poles. Place one inserter each in the gap between each furnace and the belt, so that inserters feed the fronts of the furnaces from the ore belt. Then place an inserter behind every furnace, to take iron plates out. Create a new transport belt parallel to the first one, but located behind the inserters at the back, so that the inserters will drop iron plates onto this new belt. Next, place electric poles in some of the gaps in between neighbouring furnaces so that all the inserters can be powered. You now have an extendable set up for smelting iron ore, except for the problem of refueling the furnaces.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-18-header=First furnace row 3
tutorial-chapter-4-step-18-detail=You can refuel your row of furnaces using a coal belt and long handed inserters. These special inserters take from 2 tiles ahead of them instead of 1 and drop 2 tiles behind instead of 1. Craft 5 long handed insertes and at least 15 more belts. Place a long handed inserter next to every inserter feeding a furnace, and make sure they face the same way. The long handed inserters will be ready to take from a new coal belt that you can build just next to the ore belt. The long handed inserters will drop the coal into the back sides of the furnaces while the ore inserters were dropping into the front sides, but this will not affect how the furnaces work. Finally, you have a fully automated furnace row!

tutorial-chapter-4-step-19-header=Output chests
tutorial-chapter-4-step-19-detail=Now that you are working with whole rows and belts of items instead of single machines of items, it is useful to create collection points at the ends of belts. This can be done by placing an inserter at the side of a belt as it exists an area and a chest behind the inserter. These colleection points can be good fast travel points. Consider setting up such an output chest for your furnace row.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-20-header=About machine rows
tutorial-chapter-4-step-20-detail=This concept of rows of buildings spaced out along the sides of transport belts is the core concept of building extendable factory areas. You can set up rows of assembling machines along belts in the same way and each machine can have easy access to one or two belts at both its front and at its back, meaning that you can easily use up to four different belts in total. Consider using this design later to produce large amounts of science packs.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-21-header=The next steps 
tutorial-chapter-4-step-21-detail=With your power and research ready to go and the basic factory machines now covered, you are ready to keep exploring new technologies and growing the factory. In general, your goal should be to aim for the next science pack until you are ready to build the rocket silo. New systems, resources, and challenges will become available to you along the way.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-1-header=Chapter 5, Tips and tricks
tutorial-chapter-5-step-1-detail=Chapter 5, Tips and tricks

tutorial-chapter-5-step-2-header=Press "F" to pick up items.
tutorial-chapter-5-step-2-detail=For items that have been dropped onto the ground or onto belts, you can pick them up by standing on top of them and holding "F".

tutorial-chapter-5-step-3-header=Menu search
tutorial-chapter-5-step-3-detail=As you get more types and amount of items, it might be easier to find something in a menu using the search box. Press "CONTROL + F" to open the search box and type in the item name and press "ENTER" to save. When your last search term has been saved, you can press "SHIFT + ENTER" to run the search on any menu. In some menus you can also search backwards by pressing "CONTROL + ENTER".

tutorial-chapter-5-step-4-header=Transport belt lanes
tutorial-chapter-5-step-4-detail=Transport belts all have two lanes, and inserters interact with them using specific rules. You can safely ignore this if you use only one type of item for each belt. Learning and using lane management can allow you to reliably transport two types of items on each belt, or to use the full capacity of a belt when high item traffic is needed.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-5-header=Belt fullness reflects production issues
tutorial-chapter-5-step-5-detail=In general, if you aim to have more machines filling each belt than emptying it, you can expect belts to be usually full. This is useful for identifying belts quickly, and also any empty belt would be a sign to indicate a production problem.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-6-header=Leave space
tutorial-chapter-5-step-6-detail=There is usually plenty of building space that you can find or create easily. Aim to leave at least 10 tiles of space between different production areas since you never know when you might need to pass a new belt through an area.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-7-header=Rebuilding is normal
tutorial-chapter-5-step-7-detail=It is a normal part of Factorio to pick up all the buildings in an area and build something new and better. This is a great solution when you are feeling stuck.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-8-header=Instant mining tool
tutorial-chapter-5-step-8-detail=You can clear a large number of buildings using the instant mining tool. Press "CONTROL + X" to take it in hand and press "Q" to remove it. In this mode every building the cursor touches is instantly mined, and you can also instantly mine every building within 10 tiles of the cursor by pressing "SHIFT + X" while this tool is in hand.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-9-header=Machines take what they need
tutorial-chapter-5-step-9-detail=You may have noticed that inserters do not try to completely fill up building input slots. The rule they use is to gather enough input ingredients for two more crafting cycles but not more, so that the majority of materials can remain on the belt or in the chest in front of the inserter for other inserters to use. The same applies to inserters refueling machines, except for trains.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-10-header=Production has ratios
tutorial-chapter-5-step-10-detail=It is feasible to use any number of machines that you want for any task, but in general there are numerical limits and ratios to help guide things. For example, three assembling machines making copper cable are precisely enough for supplying two assembling machines making electronic circuits.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-11-header=Power management
tutorial-chapter-5-step-11-detail=It is a good idea to keep track of your power grid. Examining any electric pole will report how its power grid is doing. Low power will slow down machines but they will keep on working, although if your coal mining drills slow down too much they might not be able to catch up with the demand from your boilers and you will have to disconnect part of your factory until your coal supply is restored.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-12-header=Warnings menu
tutorial-chapter-5-step-12-detail=You can press "P" to open the warnings menu. In addition to check machine statuses, this menu can identify some factory problems for you.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-13-header=Mall building
tutorial-chapter-5-step-13-detail=While producing science packs is the main goal of a factory, it is also a good idea to make the factory also produce items and buildings for you to use yourself, like assembling machines making assembling machines for you. You can dedicate some output chests or a design an area for this. The community likes to call these areas "malls" or "hubs".

tutorial-chapter-5-step-14-header=Lab chaining
tutorial-chapter-5-step-14-detail=Research labs have a handy feature where an inserter can take any science pack from one lab and put it in another. You can use this idea to make a simple chain of labs, where only the first one needs to be supplied from a belt or a chest.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-15-header=Chest slot locking
tutorial-chapter-5-step-15-detail=Chest inventories have a special feature where you can lock slots, starting from the last one and up until the first one, using "PAGE UP" or "PAGE DOWN". Locked slots can be emptied by inserters as usual, but they cannot be filled by inserters. Therefore you can limit how much a chest can be filled, and thus how much it drains your factory resources.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-16-header=Combat
tutorial-chapter-5-step-16-detail=While it was not mentioned so far, depending on the planet you landed on, you might need to worry about enemies in the area. It is a good idea to produce bullets and research a little bit of military technology just in case.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-17-header=More at the wiki
tutorial-chapter-5-step-17-detail=While the basics are covered here, there are several more features and tricks and shortcuts that you can find on the Factorio Access Wiki.
