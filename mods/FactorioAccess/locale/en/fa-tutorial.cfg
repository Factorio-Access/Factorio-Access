tutorial-chapter-0-message-4=Keyboard warning: An important key is "LEFT BRACKET" and your system reads it out as "__CONTROL__leftbracket-key-id__". Similarly, another important key is "RIGHT BRACKET" and your system reads it out as "__CONTROL__rightbracket-key-id__". You may want to adjust your reader settings to include square brackets, and if your system reads a different key name entirely, you can expect these two keys to be located to the right of your "P" key.

#--Chapter 1-- Length: 28
tutorial-chapter-1-step-1-header=Chapter 1, Welcome to Nauvis, you need iron
tutorial-chapter-1-step-1-detail=Chapter 1, Welcome to Nauvis, you need iron

tutorial-chapter-1-step-2-header=Status report: You need iron
tutorial-chapter-1-step-2-detail=You have survived the landing unharmed but your spaceship is completely wrecked. You will need to build a new rocket from scratch to get back to space. This will require plenty of resources and specialized buildings to process them. But to do any of that, you first need to acquire some iron.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-3-header=Walking around
tutorial-chapter-1-step-3-detail=You can walk around by pressing "__CONTROL__move-up__", "__CONTROL__move-left__", "__CONTROL__move-down__", "__CONTROL__move-right__", with "__CONTROL__move-up__" facing the north. When you press a new direction, you will only turn around on the first press. As you walk, the cursor system will identify the terrain or the entity in front of you.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-4-header=Coordinate system
tutorial-chapter-1-step-4-detail=The coordinate system has been established with your crash site at point 0,0. You can check your cursor coordinate by pressing "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__". Walking East will increase the X coordinate and walking South will increase the Y coordinate. 1 unit forward means 1 tile forward, which is about 1 meter of distance.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-5-header=Cursor Mode
tutorial-chapter-1-step-5-detail=Instead of walking, you can also use Cursor Mode, where your cursor moves around while you stand in place. This is useful for examining other objects behind an obstacle in front of you. Press "__CONTROL__toggle-cursor__" to toggle Cursor Mode, and press "__CONTROL__return-cursor-to-player__" to return the cursor back to you. Press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" to read the cursor coordinates or press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-distance-and-direction__" to get the cursor's distance and direction from you.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-6-header=Entity scanner tool part 1
tutorial-chapter-1-step-6-detail=To find objects further away, the entity scanner tool is essential. You can run a scan by pressing "__CONTROL__rescan__". To explore the scan results list, press "__CONTROL__scan-list-up__" and "__CONTROL__scan-list-down__". You can also press "__CONTROL__scan-list-middle__" to reread the current scan list entry. Reading an entry will make your cursor jump to it. This scanner indexes all nearby objects at the time of scanning, and they will be listed in terms of their types and their distances from your original scanning point. 

tutorial-chapter-1-step-7-header=Entity scanner tool part 2
tutorial-chapter-1-step-7-detail=Furthermore, you can press "__CONTROL__scan-selection-up__" or "__CONTROL__scan-selection-down__" to switch between different instances of the same entity, again listed by their distance to the reference point. If you want to reset the reference point, you can press "__CONTROL__scan-sort-by-distance__" or run a new scan.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-8-header=Entity scanner tool part 3
tutorial-chapter-1-step-8-detail=You can also filter the scan list to mention only a specific category of entities. Switch your filter categories by pressing "__CONTROL__scan-category-up__" or "__CONTROL__scan-category-down__". Take a moment to examine what is around. You can press "__CONTROL__item-info-last-indexed__" to hear the description for the last indexed entity.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-9-header=Salvaging iron plates
tutorial-chapter-1-step-9-detail=It seems that some iron plates can be salvaged from inside the wreckage pieces of your spaceship. Your scanner is able to identify these wreckage pieces. You can walk over to them to access them or you can access objects that are up to 10 tiles away while in Cursor Mode. You can empty out a cursor selected entity by pressing "__CONTROL__fast-entity-transfer-info__".

tutorial-chapter-1-step-10-header=Finding iron ore
tutorial-chapter-1-step-10-detail=You still need more iron, but the good news is that iron ore can be found in large patches across the surface. Locate the nearest iron ore patch by using the scanner tool. You can set the category to "Resources" to narrow down the search results. Head over to the resource patch.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-11-header=Smooth walking mode
tutorial-chapter-1-step-11-detail=Press "__CONTROL__toggle-walk__" to toggle smooth walking mode. In this mode you turn and start moving instantly. You are no longer locked to the coordinate grid and you run as long as the buttons stay pressed, including diagonal directions. The cursor does not read the terrain of tiles in this mode.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-12-header=Mining iron ore
tutorial-chapter-1-step-12-detail=You can mine an ore tile by holding down "__CONTROL__mine-access-sounds__". This will take some time but you will get one of the several ore pieces of the tile. Mine a few pieces now.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-13-header=Ore needs to smelted
tutorial-chapter-1-step-13-detail=The ore needs to be smelted in a furnace for it to be usable. You should have a small furnace unit in your inventory, among the emergency equipment you grabbed while evacuating the ship.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-14-header=About inventory 1
tutorial-chapter-1-step-14-detail=All the items you hold can be found in your inventory, except for equipped items. The inventory is a grid of 9 rows and 10 columns of slots for items. Items are kept in stacks, where multiple items can be added into the same slot until a stack size limit, which depends on the item.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-15-header=About inventory 2
tutorial-chapter-1-step-15-detail=Press "__CONTROL__open-inventory__" to toggle your inventory. Use the movement keys to navigate inventory slots and press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" to read the current inventory slot coordinates. When you go off the edge of the inventory, you wrap back around the other side. Selected item names will be read, and you can press "__CONTROL__item-info__" to read the description for an item, and press "__CONTROL__click-menu__" to take the item in hand.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-16-header=Grab your furnace
tutorial-chapter-1-step-16-detail=Find the stone furnace in your inventory and take it in hand by pressing "__CONTROL__click-menu__" and then press "__CONTROL__close-menu-access__" to close the inventory. The item is now still in your hand, and you can read your hand by pressing "__CONTROL__read-hand__".

tutorial-chapter-1-step-17-header=Building placement from hand
tutorial-chapter-1-step-17-detail=For the building in hand, the cursor reports preview information about trying to place it at the cursor location. You can press "__CONTROL__clear-cursor__" to empty the hand into your inventory, or press "__CONTROL__click-hand__" to confirm and place the building. Place the furnace down somewhere on the ore patch.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-18-header=Building quick info and status checks
tutorial-chapter-1-step-18-detail=The furnace is now on the ground. When you examine it you might notice that it reports being out of fuel or raw materials. These quick reports are good for checking a building instantly, but most buildings also report status information. You can check a building's status and some other stats by pressing "__CONTROL__read-entity-status__" on it.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-19-header=Building menus
tutorial-chapter-1-step-19-detail=To check inside a building, open its menu by pressing "__CONTROL__click-entity__". This will open one of several building sectors, usually the output. You can switch between sectors using "__CONTROL__switch-menu-or-gun__" and "__CONTROL__reverse-switch-menu-or-gun__" and you can close the menu by pressing "__CONTROL__close-menu-access__". One of the sectors is the player inventory, available for convenience but with fewer features than usual.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-20-header=Add ore to a furnace
tutorial-chapter-1-step-20-detail=To get the furnace working, you will need to add the iron ore and some fuel. From the player inventory sector you can grab the ore stack in hand and switch to the input sector and put in the stack by pressing "__CONTROL__click-menu__". 

tutorial-chapter-1-step-21-header=Take half a stack from your inventory
tutorial-chapter-1-step-21-detail=Next you should add some fuel. The rocket fuel you recovered from the ship can be used here and it will keep this furnace going for a long time. To use the fuel sparingly, you can take only half of the fuel stack. Close the furnace menu and open your inventory by itself. Find the rocket fuel stack and press "__CONTROL__click-menu-right__" to take only half of the stack in hand. Normally you would not need to close the furnace menu, but some shortcuts like this are unavailable for player inventory access through buildings.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-22-header=Add fuel to a furnace
tutorial-chapter-1-step-22-detail=Open the furnace again and place the rocket fuel into the fuel sector slot. One unit of fuel is automatically moved into the smelting chamber when smelting begins and it is consumed as the furnace works. If the furnace is interrupted, the fuel consumption also stops, so fuel is never wasted. The partially consumed fuel is lost only if you pick up the furnace.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-23-header=Collect iron plates
tutorial-chapter-1-step-23-detail=The furnace is working now. You can collect iron plates from the output sector slot as they become ready one at a time. You will need to mine more ore and add it to keep the furnace going, but you can let your mining drills do that for you.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-24-header=Mining drills
tutorial-chapter-1-step-24-detail=You also had a fuel-powered burner mining drill as part of your emergency equipment. You can set up this mining drill in such a way that it directly mines and drops ore into the furnace. This is more easily done in Cursor Mode.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-25-header=Building in Cursor Mode
tutorial-chapter-1-step-25-detail=Open your inventory and grab the burner mining drill. Close the inventory by pressing "__CONTROL__close-menu-access__" and then enable Cursor Mode by pressing "__CONTROL__toggle-cursor__". This will make the build preview move around with the cursor while you stand still.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-26-header=Precise drill alignment
tutorial-chapter-1-step-26-detail= The drill in hand is a 2 by 2 building, like the furnace on the ground. In cursor mode, a building is always held by its northwest corner (or its top left corner). Place the drill somewhere on the ore patch such that it is fully aligned wall-to-wall with the stone furnace. When the cursor is over the furnace, you can press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" to check which part of the building is currently under the cursor.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-27-header=Rotating mining drills
tutorial-chapter-1-step-27-detail=The mining drill is a building with a direction. It will drop mined ore from a chute at its front face, towards the direction that the drill faces. In this case, the drill needs to face the furnace. For example, if the furnace is at the west of the drill, then the drill needs to face the west. Press "__CONTROL__rotate-building__" or "__CONTROL__reverse-rotate-building__" on the drill to rotate it. Note that you can also rotate a building preview in hand, and some buildings, like furnaces, never need to be rotated.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-28-header=You will need more fuel
tutorial-chapter-1-step-28-detail=If you have any fuel left over you can add it to the drill now to get it working too, but both the drill and the furnace will run out of fuel eventually. You are getting iron now but your next goal is to set up a reliable fuel supply.


#--Chapter 2-- Length: 22
tutorial-chapter-2-step-1-header=Chapter 2, Get coal and get crafting
tutorial-chapter-2-step-1-detail=Chapter 2, Get coal and get crafting

tutorial-chapter-2-step-2-header=Coal sources
tutorial-chapter-2-step-2-detail=Coal is an ideal fuel source. Like iron ore, it can be mined from patches by hand or by using drills. It can also be found inside huge rocks that can be found across the surface. The huge rocks also yield some stone. Meanwhile, big rocks yield only stone.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-3-header=About fast travel
tutorial-chapter-2-step-3-detail=Before leaving your machines to go find coal, note that you will need to return to the iron ore patch several times. Therefore it would be good to set up a fast travel point here. This is a feature of the teleporter tool, which allows you to create and use any number of labeled fast travel points. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-4-header=Create a fast travel point
tutorial-chapter-2-step-4-detail=Open the fast travel menu by pressing "__CONTROL__open-fast-travel-menu__" and follow the instructions to create a point near the furnace.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-5-header=Teleporting
tutorial-chapter-2-step-5-detail=The teleporter tool can also be used at any time to teleport to the cursor location by pressing "__CONTROL__teleport-to-cursor__". When you combine this feature with the scan list making the cursor jump to indexed entities, it means that you can simply teleport to an indexed entity after finding it with the scanner.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-6-header=Locate and mine a huge rock
tutorial-chapter-2-step-6-detail=Look for a huge rock using the scanner, and then teleport or walk to it, and mine it by holding "__CONTROL__mine-access-sounds__". If you cannot locate any huge rocks, try big rocks instead, or else try coal patches and stone patches. To recap on the scanner controls, you run a scan by pressing "__CONTROL__rescan__", navigate the list with "__CONTROL__scan-list-up__" and "__CONTROL__scan-list-down__", or "__CONTROL__scan-list-middle__" to repeat, and switch your filter categories by pressing "__CONTROL__scan-category-up__" or "__CONTROL__scan-category-down__".  

tutorial-chapter-2-step-7-header=Gather coal and stone
tutorial-chapter-2-step-7-detail=Using any rocks you can find, aim to gather at least 50 coal and 50 stone, which is one stack each for these items. If you can only find ore patches, aim to mine by hand until you have 20 coal and 40 stone.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-8-header=Refuel buildings and collect iron plates
tutorial-chapter-2-step-8-detail=Use the fast travel menu to return to your furnace and miner and collect iron plates from the furnace output sector. If either of them are out of fuel, take half of a coal stack from your inventory using "__CONTROL__click-menu-right__" and place it into the fuel sector slot. If there is rocket fuel left in the fuel slot, you can keep using it, or save it for later by clicking on it with the coal stack in hand. This swaps the stacks to make you hold the rocket fuel instead, and then you can put it away by pressing "__CONTROL__clear-cursor__".

tutorial-chapter-2-step-9-header=First crafting goals
tutorial-chapter-2-step-9-detail=To get a steady coal supply and an improved supply of iron, it would be much nicer to have more drills and furnaces working for you, and now you have the raw materials for crafting them.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-10-header=Crafting menu
tutorial-chapter-2-step-10-detail=Press "__CONTROL__open-inventory__" to open the player inventory menu, which is the main character menu. Press "__CONTROL__switch-menu-or-gun__" to switch to the crafting menu. This menu lets you browse the crafting recipe list. Items are grouped into four categories: logistics, production, intermediate products, and combat. You can switch category by pressing "__CONTROL__move-up__" or "__CONTROL__move-down__" and you can navigate within a category by pressing "__CONTROL__move-left__" or "__CONTROL__move-right__". Find stone furnaces in the "production" category and craft a furnace by pressing "__CONTROL__click-menu__". When crafting is complete, the items appear in your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-11-header=Crafting in bulk
tutorial-chapter-2-step-11-detail=Craft six more furnaces so that you have seven in total. You can press "__CONTROL__crafting-5__" on a recipe to craft it 5 times instead of 1 time.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-12-header=Crafting mining drills using existing furnaces
tutorial-chapter-2-step-12-detail=Next in the crafting menu, find burner mining drills within the "production" category. Press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" to check the ingredients needed. Note that it includes stone furnaces that you already crafted, and iron gear wheels that you do not have. Press "__CONTROL__crafting-5__" to craft 5 burner mining drills in one key press. The crafting queue will take the furnaces you already have, and it will also automatically take iron plates and make gear wheels before making the drills.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-13-header=Self-feeding coal supply part 1
tutorial-chapter-2-step-13-detail=Now that you have extra mining drills, you can use some to mine coal. Head over to the coal patch and place down a drill near the middle.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-14-header=Self-feeding coal supply part 2
tutorial-chapter-2-step-14-detail=Now use cursor mode to place down a second mining drill aligned wall to wall with the first. Then rotate both drills to face each other and add 1 piece of coal to each. Because they are both mining coal, the drills will output into each other's fuel slots and keep each other running as long as there is space to drop the coal. You can then collect the coal from both at any time. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-15-header=Start smelting copper
tutorial-chapter-2-step-15-detail=With iron and coal solved for now, you can move onto other resources like copper. You will need a fair amount of copper later on so it is a good idea to set up one drill feeding one furnace at the nearest copper ore patch. Use the same arrangements as before for iron and perhaps set up fast travel points for each area. Make sure to refuel the machines from time to time.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-16-header=Find trees with area scanning
tutorial-chapter-2-step-16-detail=Your next required resource is wood. You can locate forests from the scanner tool and chop down trees to get wood. Trees do not grow back but you do not need that much wood anyway. Travel over to the nearest forest now. Within a forest, trees are nearby but not necessarily easy to find. You can use Cursor Mode to find them, especially using Area Scanning Mode. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-17-header=Area scanning
tutorial-chapter-2-step-17-detail=To use area scanning, press "__CONTROL__toggle-cursor__" to toggle Cursor Mode. You can then press "__CONTROL__cursor-size-increment__" and "__CONTROL__cursor-size-decrement__" to change the cursor size. For cursor sizes greater than 1 the cursor reports all the found entities within its area. Use this to find trees. You can press "DIRECTION KEYS" to move the cursor by its size for each press, or you can press "ARROW KEYS" to move the cursor by only 1 tile at any size. You can then press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-distance-and-direction__" to get the relative position of the cursor box and walk over to it.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-18-header=Area mining
tutorial-chapter-2-step-18-detail=A faster alternative method for clearing trees and also rocks is area mining. When youı press "__CONTROL__mine-area__" on a tree or a rock or an empty tile, this will quickly mine all such entities within 10 tiles of the cursor tile. This is especially useful when these entities are obstructing you from building in an area.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-19-header=Start mining stone
tutorial-chapter-2-step-19-detail=When you have at least one stack of wood, you can move onto automating your stone supply. Place down a mining drill by itself in the middle of the stone patch and add fuel to it. Note that it drops one unit on the ground and then stops due to its output being full. Therefore you need to put a chest in front of it. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-20-header=Stone collection chest
tutorial-chapter-2-step-20-detail=Craft 1 wooden chest from the logistics category and place it where the ground item is, in front of the miner's output chute. The stone is collected in its raw form so that it can be used for crafting more furnaces, but it can also be smelted in a furnace to make stone bricks that you can pave the floor with.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-21-header=Chests
tutorial-chapter-2-step-21-detail=Chests are useful because they have many output slots instead of one, and mining drills can drop directly into them. Chests are identified by the scanner according to the item they contain if there is only one type.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-22-header=Ready to scale up
tutorial-chapter-2-step-22-detail=Now you have prepared at least 1 machine each for producing coal, iron plates, copper plates, and raw stone. You can consider this as your first factory, ready to help you make a bigger and better factory. Your next steps should be to set up some more pairs of iron miners and furnaces, because you will still need stacks and stacks full of iron. Along the way, consider using some keyboard shortcuts, which will now be introduced.


#--Chapter 3-- Length: 8
tutorial-chapter-3-step-1-header=Chapter 3, Scaling up and shortcuts
tutorial-chapter-3-step-1-detail=Chapter 3, Scaling up and shortcuts

tutorial-chapter-3-step-2-header=Quickbar shortcuts part 1
tutorial-chapter-3-step-2-detail=The quickbar is a system for you to assign shortcut numbers to instantly get items from your inventory. It is very useful to do this for frequently used items such as coal. To set up a quickbar slot for an item, take it in hand or select from the inventory and press "CONTROL + DIGIT", where the digit could be between 0 and 9 from the keyboard. If you press the same "DIGIT" again, you will now grab that assigned item from your inventory to your hand. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-3-header=Quickbar shortcuts part 2
tutorial-chapter-3-step-3-detail=You can use up to 10 different quickbars. You switch to a different quickbar by pressing "SHIFT + DIGIT", with the digit for your desired quickbar. For your first quickbar, it is very useful to add coal, furnaces, and mining drills.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-header=Smart pipette tool shortcut
tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-detail=The smart pipette tool, or the picker tool, is another shortcut for grabbing items from your inventory. When you select an entity with the cursor, like when looking at a building in front of you, press "__CONTROL__pipette-tool-info__" to use the smart pipette. It will grab from your inventory the item form of this entity, if you have it. Otherwise it will do nothing. For ore on the ground, this tool has an additional shortcut that makes you grab a mining drill instead of ore from your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-5-header=Smart inserting between inventories
tutorial-chapter-3-step-5-detail=There are also smart shortcuts for inserting items into buildings. When working with building menus, when you select an item slot in your inventory, you can press "__CONTROL__transfer-one-stack__" to have the selected item stack instantly transfered into the most appropriate sector of the building. You can use this shortcut to instantly insert ore and coal from your inventory into the correct slot of a furnace. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-6-header=Smart inserting from the open world.
tutorial-chapter-3-step-6-detail=Smart inserting also works in the open world with an item in hand. If you take coal in hand, like from the quickbar, and then position your cursor over a building such as a drill, you can press "__CONTROL__drop-cursor-info__" to smart insert 1 unit from the hand stack into the building. You can also press "__CONTROL__fast-entity-split-info__" to smart insert half of the hand stack, or "__CONTROL__fast-entity-transfer-info__" to smart insert the whole hand stack. If your inventory has more of the same item in hand, the hand is immediately refilled from the inventory after you do smart inserting.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-7-header=Smart collecting from buildings
tutorial-chapter-3-step-7-detail=When your hand is empty, you can smart collect all of the available output from a cursor selected building by pressing "__CONTROL__fast-entity-transfer-info__". You can also collect just half of the total output by pressing "__CONTROL__fast-entity-split-info__".

tutorial-chapter-3-step-8-header=Scale up complete
tutorial-chapter-3-step-8-detail=Using the shortcuts described earlier, keep crafting and building to make sure you have 4 furnaces making iron plates and 2 furnaces making copper plates and 1 furnace making stone bricks, and a mining drill for each furnace. You will then have enough production for your later goals.


#--Chapter 4-- Length: 15
tutorial-chapter-4-step-1-header=Chapter 4, Belts and inserters
tutorial-chapter-4-step-1-detail=Chapter 4, Belts and inserters

tutorial-chapter-4-step-2-header=Why you need belts and inserters
tutorial-chapter-4-step-2-detail=As you may have realized, it is time consuming to carry coal from the coal mining drills to all the other machines that need it. It is also annoying that the coal mining drills have only one usable slot each and they fill up too quickly. Since you have a good iron supply now, you can build machines to carry coal for you both in and out of buildings, and across the land. The machines you need are transport belts and burner inserters, which you can craft.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-3-header=Craft machines for the coal supply belt
tutorial-chapter-4-step-3-detail=To set up a smarter coal supply using a transport belt system, first craft 15 transport belt units and 10 burner inserters from the logistics category. Also craft at least 5 burner mining drills from the production category. Head to the coal patch when ready to build. First the transport belts will be placed.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-4-header=About transport belts
tutorial-chapter-4-step-4-detail=Transport belts carry items on top of them in the direction they are facing. They do not need an energy source, and items on top of them never fall off. They have two lanes but you can safely ignore them for now, as long as you use only one type of item for each belt, such as coal-only belt.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-5-header=Pick the coal supply belt direction
tutorial-chapter-4-step-5-detail=Go to the middle of the coal ore patch and use the scanner to find the general direction of your iron ore patch. Let's say it is at the Northwest. In that case face the north or the west. Take a transport belt stack in hand and rotate the stack in hand to also face the same direction as you. Next place down one belt unit. This will mark the direction of your coal supply belt.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-6-header=Place belt units
tutorial-chapter-4-step-6-detail=Move on top of the belt unit and place another unit in the same direction. Repeat this until you reach the edge of the coal patch. With all belt units aligned in a line, you now have one long belt ready to carry coal for you. The belt does not require fuel or anything else to work, so this part of the system is good to go. 

tutorial-chapter-4-step-7-header=Place a drill along the belt
tutorial-chapter-4-step-7-detail=Now you can place a burner mining drill on the side of the transport belt, somewhere near the middle of its length. Make sure that the drill faces the belt and put some coal into it. Its coal output will drop directly onto the belt, making the coal ready to go and supply your machines located along this belt. The first machine that needs supplying will be the drill itself. This will be achieved using burner inserters.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-8-header=About burner inserters
tutorial-chapter-4-step-8-detail=An inserter is a machine that can smart collect an item from a building that is directly in front of it and then smart insert the item into a building that is directly behind it. Burner inserters work using fuel, and they can directly use the coal from their own hands to keep themselves running. In contrast, regular inserters do not need fuel but they need electric power, which can be set up later.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-9-header=Place the first burner inserter
tutorial-chapter-4-step-9-detail=A pair of burner inserters will be used to first pick up coal from the belt and then place it into the drill. Two inserters are needed since one inserter cannot load or unload sideways. Place the first burner inserter 2 tiles along the belt from the mining drill so that there is 1 tile of space between the two machines.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-10-header=Place the second burner inserter
tutorial-chapter-4-step-10-detail=When you rotate the first inserter to face the belt, it will take coal from the belt and put it on the ground behind it. Next, place the second burner inserter between the coal on the ground and the burner mining drill. This will require having the one tile gap mentioned earlier. When the second inserter faces the coal on the ground, it can take from that spot and feed the mining drill. Therefore you have a system where the drill drops coal onto the belt and the inserters use some of that coal to feed themselves and the mining drill, while the rest of the coal is free to travel along the belt to other places. 

tutorial-chapter-4-step-11-header=Copy the inserter setup
tutorial-chapter-4-step-11-detail=Repeat the pattern described earlier to place more inserters and burner mining drills along the coal belt. Use cursor mode so that you do not need to walk around the machines so much, and aim for at least 3 drills set up on both sides. This will fill up the belt quite well after a few seconds of pause while the machines first fuel up themselves. You can later prepare for extending this coal supply belt further towards the iron ore patch. 

tutorial-chapter-4-step-12-header=Prepare to extend the belt
tutorial-chapter-4-step-12-detail=Craft at least 20 more belt units. Then stand on top of the stopping end of the coal supply belt and grab more belts in hand. Note that while the belt moves items, you will not be moved by it. Make sure to turn Cursor Mode off because now you will use Build Lock Mode. You may also want to use telestep walking, which you can toggle by pressing "__CONTROL__toggle-walk__".

tutorial-chapter-4-step-13-header=Use build lock mode to extend the belt
tutorial-chapter-4-step-13-detail=Press "__CONTROL__toggle-build-lock__" to use Build Lock mode, which makes you place down buildings behind you as you walk. For transport belts with Cursor Mode disabled, changing your direction while you walk will also turn the belt direction being placed under you. Use this mode to easily extend the belt by a few tiles. Use the scanner to keep track of where the iron ore patch is and walk towards it. Build lock mode will remain active until you empty your hand or toggle another mode. 

tutorial-chapter-4-step-14-header=Finishing the coal supply belt
tutorial-chapter-4-step-14-detail=Extend the coal supply belt until you reach the iron ore patch. At the end of the belt place a burner inserter and use it to fill up a chest. This will ensure that you have multiple stacks of coal available nearby when you need to feed your iron making furnaces. You can even use some burner inserters to feed your iron ore mining drills and furnaces.

tutorial-chapter-4-step-15-header=Coal supply solved
tutorial-chapter-4-step-15-detail=Now you have a steady supply of resources, especially iron. Using belts and inserters, you also have a smart coal supply to make it much easier to refuel all your iron production machines. You are now ready to do even more automation and prepare to begin research for higher technology. This will first require setting up electricity, using a steam power system.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-1-detail=Chapter 5, Water and power

tutorial-chapter-5-step-2-header=Craft an offshore pump and pipes
tutorial-chapter-5-step-2-detail=Steam power requires a constant water supply, so water will need to be transported to the base area. To do this, craft 1 offshore pump and at least 100 pipes. You will need these to make a long water pipe from the nearest water source, over to the coal patch. Note that you will need copper to make the pump.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-3-header=Go to water
tutorial-chapter-5-step-3-detail=Use the scanner tool to locate the nearest water body. Water can be found in lakes similar to ore being found in patches, but the lakes can be a lot larger and they cannot be walked on. Make your way to the shore. Note that the scanner tool always reports the nearest edge of a large body such as a lake.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-4-header=Place the offshore pump.
tutorial-chapter-5-step-4-detail=Take the offshore pump from your inventory and press "__CONTROL__click-entity__" to run its special building assistant. The assistant will suggest good positions for placing the pump and the first suggestion is usually the nearest good position. Press "__CONTROL__click-menu__" to confirm this. The offshore pump will set up and will fill up with water instantly. It does not need any energy source so it is ready.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-5-header=Starting the water pipe
tutorial-chapter-5-step-5-detail=Take a stack of pipes in hand for transporting the water. Use Cursor Mode and maybe the scanner to locate the pump and then bring the cursor to the tile just next to the pump's output. Press "__CONTROL__click-entity__" to put down a pipe. If it is positioned correctly, the pipe will be full of water. Otherwise it will be empty.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-6-header=Extending the water pipe
tutorial-chapter-5-step-6-detail=Pipes will automatically connect to any neighboring pipes in any of the four main directions. Therefore you can put down more pipes along the first one to make an extended water pipe. You can also walk over pipes. Use the scanner tool to locate the coal patch and use Build Lock Mode to extend the water pipe all the way until just outside the edge of the patch.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-7-header=Crafting steam power machines
tutorial-chapter-5-step-7-detail=Now that you have a water supply, you can craft the buildings needed for steam power. Craft 1 boiler and 2 steam engines using iron plates and stone furnaces. You also need copper and wood now, because you should also craft 1 (regular electric) inserter and at least 1 small power pole.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-8-header=Place the boiler
tutorial-chapter-5-step-8-detail=Take the boiler in hand and use Cursor Mode. The boiler is a 3 by 2 building that has a water pipe along its back, and it has a steam output pipe on its front center. When the boiler is facing north, the water pipe ends are on its southeast and southwest corners, and its steam output is on the middle of its north side. Place it down somwhere near the end of the water pipe so that you can align it by nudging.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-9-header=Nudging buildings
tutorial-chapter-5-step-9-detail=To align buildings that you already placed down, you can nudge them by one tile at a time. This is done by pressing "CONTROL + SHIFT + DIRECTION KEY", where the direction key is "__CONTROL__move-up__" or "__CONTROL__move-left__" or "__CONTROL__move-down__" or "__CONTROL__move-right__". A nudged building can only be nudged into an empty spot. You can use this feature to make sure that the boiler is aligned correctly.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-10-header=Align the boiler
tutorial-chapter-5-step-10-detail=Nudge the boiler to get its back pipe aligned with the end of the water pipe. Any connection will work now but an aligned connection will make future constructions easier. The connected boiler will fill with water, and you can check the building to verify this. Place some coal in the aligned boiler to hear it start working and check that it now has steam in it.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-11-header=About the steam engine
tutorial-chapter-5-step-11-detail=The steam engine is a long building that is 3 by 5 tiles. Both of its short 3 tile sides provide access to a steam pipe that runs through the building and can move steam both in and out of the building. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-12-header=Placing the steam engine part 1
tutorial-chapter-5-step-12-detail=To precisely place the steam engine, first make sure that the area in front of the boiler is clear for building. Then take the steam engine in hand and enable Cursor Mode. As always, the building is held from its top left corner in Cursor Mode, and when you press "K" to check the preview position, this also reports how far the preview extends to the East and the South.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-13-header=Placing the steam engine part 2
tutorial-chapter-5-step-13-detail=Rotate the steam engine to face the same direction as the boiler. Next, bring the cursor to overlap with the part of the boiler that has the steam output. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-14-header=Placing the steam engine part 3
tutorial-chapter-5-step-14-detail=If the boiler is facing north, you now need to move 5 tiles north so that the length of the steam engine is covered and the other end is near the boiler output. If the boiler is facing south, you move just 1 tile south so that your end of the engine is near the boiler output. Similarly, you need to move 5 tiles if the boiler is facing west, or just 1 tile if it is facing east. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-15-header=Placing the steam engine part 4
tutorial-chapter-5-step-15-detail=Next, you need to move the cursor 1 tile sideways so that the middle of the three-tiles-wide boiler and the middle of the three-tiles-wide steam engine are correctly aligned. If the alignment is correct, the steam engine will now fill with steam from the boiler, and you can check the machine to verify this. One boiler can support two steam engines, so you can place your second steam engine at the other end of the first one using the same aligning technique. Use nudging if needed.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-16-header=Testing your steam power system
tutorial-chapter-5-step-16-detail=Now that your boilers and engines are set up, you can test if the electric system works by giving it a load. Place a small electric pole next to each steam engine to create your electric grid. Place your third small electric pole next to the boiler, along its empty wide side, and finally place the electric inserter next the pole and the boiler. This will make your steam engines start to work at very low speed, and you will hear them hissing.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-17-header=Automated boiler fueling
tutorial-chapter-5-step-17-detail=Rotate the inserter that you just placed to face away from the boiler. If you place a chest of coal or a belt of coal in front of this inserter, it can be used to keep the boiler constantly fueled so that your power supply is continuous. Boilers and steam engines work smartly like furnaces such that they never waste any fuel or steam when there is a low power demand.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-18-header=Ready for labs
tutorial-chapter-5-step-18-detail=With your steam power system ready to go, you are finally ready to start using research labs so that you can build more advanced buildings and systems on your way to building a rocket.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-19-header=Quickbar recommendation
tutorial-chapter-5-step-19-detail=In preparation for the next part, consider setting up a quickbar to include coal and belts and many inserter types and also electric poles.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-1-header=Chapter 6, Research and automation
tutorial-chapter-6-step-1-detail=Chapter 6, Research and automation

tutorial-chapter-6-step-2-header=Craft 1 research lab
tutorial-chapter-6-step-2-detail=Craft 1 research lab and place it in an empty area near your steam engines.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-3-header=Power the lab
tutorial-chapter-6-step-3-detail=Place a small electric pole near your power network so that you can extend it. Keep extending it towards your lab so that it has power. You can check power pole connection previews in telestep walking mode or Cursor Mode.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-4-header=About research packs
tutorial-chapter-6-step-4-detail=Open the lab to examine its slots. As revealed here, research is done by consuming science packs and electric power at your labs to do experiments. Therefore the main items you need to produce in your factory are the different types of research packs.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-5-header=Craft automation science packs
tutorial-chapter-6-step-5-detail=Craft 10 automation science packs. You will need copper plates and iron gear wheels for this. Place the packs into the lab. The filled and powered lab will begin working when you later select a technology to research.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-6-header=Select to research "automation"
tutorial-chapter-6-step-6-detail= Open the technology menu by pressing "__CONTROL__open-inventory__" to open the inventory and pressing "__CONTROL__switch-menu-or-gun__" multiple times. In this menu, technologies are sorted according to whether they are already researched, available now for research, or locked due to prerequisites. You can change technology categories with "__CONTROL__move-up__" and "__CONTROL__move-down__" and you can navigate within a category with "__CONTROL__move-left__" and "__CONTROL__move-right__". Select the technology named "Automation" and press "__CONTROL__item-info__" to read about it, press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" to read its science pack requirements, and press "__CONTROL__click-menu__" to start researching it.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-7-header=Research progress
tutorial-chapter-6-step-7-detail=You can hear the electricity crackle as a lab works. You can check the planet's local time and current research progress by pressing "__CONTROL__read-time-and-research-progress__". You will hear the notification sound when the research is complete. Research progress is permanent such that you can interrupt one research to start another and then return to the first one without issues.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-8-header=About assembling machines
tutorial-chapter-6-step-8-detail=Researching "Automation" has unlocked the recipe for assembling machines, which are at the heart of Factorio, because they automate crafting for you. Building a bigger factory requires crafting a lot of parts and the machines to make those parts. Therefore automated crafting at large scales is the solution for getting everything done within reasonable time. Assembling machines are large electric powered crafting machines. They are accessed using inserters and they craft without stopping as long as they have the space and ingredients and power to keep working. 

tutorial-chapter-6-step-9-header=Setting up your first assembling machine
tutorial-chapter-6-step-9-detail=Craft an assembling machine and place it down. The first thing you need to do with it is to set its crafting recipe. Select the automation science pack, and then set up small electric poles to power the machine. The tier 1 assembling machine crafts half as fast as you and it requires exact ingredients to work rather than just raw materials, but you can build any number of them.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-10-header=Parallel crafting with assembling machines 
tutorial-chapter-6-step-10-detail=Now grab some copper plates and drop them into the assembling machine. Craft some iron gear wheels by hand and drop them into the machine too. Next, continue crafting iron gear wheels while the machine makes automation science packs for you. Therefore you are now crafting two things at once.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-11-header=Automate automation science packs: Place machines
tutorial-chapter-6-step-11-detail=Craft a second assembling machine and two inserters. Pick up your first assembling machine by mining it and then place it next to your lab with 1 tile of space. Place the other assembling machine next to the first 1 with again 1 tile of space in between. Configure the second machine to produce iron gear wheels and the first machine to produce automation science packs. 

tutorial-chapter-6-step-12-header=Automate automation science packs: Place inserters
tutorial-chapter-6-step-12-detail=Place one inserter between the two assemblers and another inserter between the science pack assembler and the lab. Rotate the inserters so that the gear assembler feeds the science pack assembler, which feeds the lab. Finally add electric poles and now you are done.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-13-header=Status review
tutorial-chapter-6-step-13-detail=You have a factory that converts metal plates into science! The next goal will be to fully automate your iron supply in an extendable way so that your science production can be fully automated from mine to lab.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-1-header=Chapter 7, Mass produce iron using belts
tutorial-chapter-7-step-1-detail=Chapter 7, Mass produce iron using belts

tutorial-chapter-7-step-2-header=Research "Logistics"
tutorial-chapter-7-step-2-detail=Select "Logistics" as the next technology to research. This will unlock underground belts, which allow moving short sections of transport belts underground so that they can avoid obstacles or other belts. It also unlocks belt splitters, which are useful machines that allow you to do things like splitting one belt into two belts with the contents divided equally. These machines will be very useful when you start using more belts later.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-3-header=Electric mining drills
tutorial-chapter-7-step-3-detail=While waiting for research, you can scale up your ore production by switching to electric mining drills. Craft 4 of them now. They are twice as fast as burner mining drills, and they can mine a wider area, and they are more energy efficient, and energizing them with electric poles is much easier than refeueling a drill using coal belts and inserters.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-4-header=Create an iron ore belt
tutorial-chapter-7-step-4-detail=Craft 15 transport belts and go to your iron ore patch. Face a direction that has empty space ahead, and place down the belts in a straight line, as before. 

tutorial-chapter-7-step-5-header=Place electric mining drills
tutorial-chapter-7-step-5-detail=Place your electric mining drills along both sides of this belt. They can be wall to wall or with up to 2 spaces in between while they maintain full coverage of the ore around them. Rotate them to face the belt. Then place electric poles around them to supply energy, with every small electric pole able to reach at most 2 drills. This completes the iron ore belt. 

tutorial-chapter-7-step-6-header=First furnace row: Check the space
tutorial-chapter-7-step-6-detail=Next comes mass smelting. Extend the iron ore belt into the empty space beyond the ore patch. Note that this space needs to be at least 10 tiles wide and at least 20 tiles long in order to make the system fit comfortably. You can estimate how much empty space is around you by moving to the middle of your empty space and running the scanner tool. If nearby objects are at least 10 tiles away, that generally means that you have empty space in every direction for at least 10 tiles, and you can easily fit a 10 by 10 factory area there, with you standing at the center point.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-7-header=First furnace row: Place furnaces
tutorial-chapter-7-step-7-detail=Craft 4 stone furnaces and use Cursor Mode to precisely place them in one row along the same side of the belt, with 1 tile of gap space in between each furnace and the belt, and 1 tile of gap space between each furnace and its neighbour. For the purpose of clarity, from now on the parts of the furnaces that face the belt can be considered as their front sides.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-8-header=First furnace row: Place input inserters
tutorial-chapter-7-step-8-detail=Craft 15 belts, 10 inserters and at least 3 electric poles. Place one inserter each in the gap between each furnace and the ore belt, so that inserters feed the fronts of the furnaces from the ore belt. 

tutorial-chapter-7-step-9-header=First furnace row: Place output inserters and belt
tutorial-chapter-7-step-9-detail=Next, place an inserter behind every furnace, to take iron plates out. Create a new transport belt parallel to the first one, but located behind the inserters at the back, so that the inserters will drop iron plates onto this new belt. 

tutorial-chapter-7-step-10-header=First furnace row: Place electric poles 
tutorial-chapter-7-step-10-detail=Now, place electric poles in between neighbouring furnaces so that all the inserters can be powered. In this case it is enough to place a pole in every second gap. You now have an extendable set up for smelting iron ore, except for the problem of refueling the furnaces.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-11-header=First furnace row: Extend the coal belt
tutorial-chapter-7-step-11-detail=You can refuel your row of furnaces by redirecting your iron ore patch's coal belt, since you will not be using the burner machines any more. Extend the belt to make it run directly next to the iron ore belt.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-12-header=First furnace row: Add long handed inserters
tutorial-chapter-7-step-12-detail=Craft 4 long handed inserters and place 1 next to every input inserter, facing the same direction. The long handed inserters take from 2 tiles ahead of them instead of 1 and drop 2 tiles behind instead of 1. In this case they will take from the coal belt and drop into the back sides of the furnaces, but building sides do not matter for any type of inserter interaction. Finally, you have a fully automated furnace row!

tutorial-chapter-7-step-13-header=Row output chests
tutorial-chapter-7-step-13-detail=Now that you are working with rows of machines and belts of items, it is useful to create collection points at the ends of the rows. This can be done by placing an inserter at the side of a belt at the end of the row, and placing a chest behind the inserter. These colleection points can be good fast travel points for collecting items. Consider setting up such an output chest for your furnace row.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-1-detail=Chapter 8, Complete the automation science pack factory

tutorial-chapter-8-step-2-header=Next you will automate copper
tutorial-chapter-8-step-2-detail=You now have an extendable iron plate supply, which is exactly what you need for a growing factory. You need something similar for copper as well, using the electric mining drill and furnace row arrangement just described. Set up the copper ore belt now.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-3-header=Splitting the coal belt
tutorial-chapter-8-step-3-detail=For your copper smelting area, you will need a new coal supply belt. You can create a new belt at your coal patch, but alternatively you can also split your coal supply belt into two using a splitter. Make sure the research of "Logistics" has been completed, and craft 1 splitter. 

tutorial-chapter-8-step-4-header=About splitters
tutorial-chapter-8-step-4-detail=A splitter is a transport belt system machine that is two tiles wide and 1 tile long. It can input two belts from its wide back and output two belts from its wide front, but its narrow sides have no belt access. The splitter works by taking from its input belts at equal speed and distributing to its output belts at equal speed. Therefore you can take one or two input belts, such as coal belts, and split them equally between two output belts.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-5-header=Select the splitting point
tutorial-chapter-8-step-5-detail=Select a point along your coal suppply belt where you want to split it in two. Consider the path a new coal supply belt from your coal patch would need to take to reach your copper patch, and consider how much of this path can overlap with the path you already have to the iron ore patch. The place where the two paths diverge is often the best place for the splitter.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-6-header=Place the splitter
tutorial-chapter-8-step-6-detail=Take the splitter in hand and rotate it to face the same direction as the belt on the ground. Move the cursor over the belt. You can either place the splitter here directly, or you can move it one tile to the side before placing it, depending on whether you want the new belt output to go to the left or the right of the existing belt. Placing the splitter will automatically put the replaced belt unit back into your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-7-header=Extend the coal belt
tutorial-chapter-8-step-7-detail=Place a belt unit in front of the empty output of the splitter, and your new coal supply belt is ready. Extend this belt until it reaches your planned copper smelting area. While building your new belt, your path might require crossing over obstacles such as another transport belt. This is where you can use underground belts. 

tutorial-chapter-8-step-8-header=About underground belts part 1
tutorial-chapter-8-step-8-detail=The underground belt item is actually the entrance chute for an underground belt segment. You rotate the item to face the same direction as the belt on the ground and place it down to create the entrance chute.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-9-header=About underground belts part 2
tutorial-chapter-8-step-9-detail=You can place another underground belt chute up to 4 tiles away. The chute needs to face the same direction as the entrance chute, and the preview will read whether it is connected. When you place a connected chute, the underground belt segment is created automatically between the two chutes and for free. The underground segment does not interact with anything including any other underground belt segments.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-10-header=Build the copper smelting row
tutorial-chapter-8-step-10-detail=Build your copper smelting furnace row with the same design as the iron smelthing furnace row.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-11-header=Extend your metal plate belts
tutorial-chapter-8-step-11-detail=When your copper smelting area is completed, next extend your iron plate belt and your copper plate belt to a new empty area where you can use rows of assembling machines to make iron gear wheels and automation science packs. Use underground belts if needed. This new area will need to be about 20 tiles wide and at least 30 tiles long.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-12-header=Place a row of assembling machines
tutorial-chapter-8-step-12-detail=Extend your two belts directly side by side across the middle of your new area. Place 6 assembling machines along one side with 1 tile of space in between the machines and the belt, and again 1 tile of space between neighbouring machines.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-13-header=Configure a row of assembling machines
tutorial-chapter-8-step-13-detail=Configure the first assembling machine in your row to make iron gear wheels. This machine will be fast enough by itself to supply up to 10 assembling machines making automation science packs. Configure the 5 other assembling machines to make the science packs. You can use the entity settings copy-paste shortcuts here, which were "__CONTROL__copy-entity-settings-info__" to copy and "__CONTROL__paste-entity-settings-info__" to paste.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-14-header=Place iron gear wheel inserters
tutorial-chapter-8-step-14-detail=Place an inserter to feed the iron gear wheel assembler with iron plates. You will need either a regular inserter or a long handed inserter, depending on how you arranged your belts. Behind the assembler, place a regular inserter for taking out the gear wheels. 

tutorial-chapter-8-step-15-header=Place the output belts
tutorial-chapter-8-step-15-detail=Craft transport belts, and starting from the iron gear wheel output inserter, create a new belt that runs along the back of the row of machines. This will be your iron gear wheel belt for supplying the science pack assemblers. Next, create a new belt parallel to the iron gear belt, and this one will be used to collect the finished science packs from the row.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-16-header=Complete the science pack assembling row
tutorial-chapter-8-step-16-detail=Place inserters and long handed inserters and power poles as necessary so that your machines are all working or full.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-17-header=About machine rows
tutorial-chapter-8-step-17-detail=You have now used all 4 easily accessible belts around this row of assembling machines but the row gets the job done. The row can be extended easily if you want a larger factory overall. Spaced out machine rows like these are the core concept of building extendable factory areas of any kind. You can create all kinds of rows like this, and learning about more techniques such as belt lanes will help you come up with different designs.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-18-header=Use the science packs
tutorial-chapter-8-step-18-detail=You can extend your science pack belt to go to a row of labs. With 5 science pack assemblers, you can easily run 5 to 10 labs continuously. You will need to extend your furnace rows and ore mining rows to feed your assembling machines. The overall factory size you want will depend on your target science research speed, but 5 automation science pack assemblers gives a fairly good speed. 

tutorial-chapter-8-step-19-header=The next steps 
tutorial-chapter-8-step-19-detail=With your power and basic research all ready to go, you are ready to keep exploring new technologies and growing the factory. In general, your goal should be to aim for the next science pack until you are ready to build the rocket silo. New systems, resources, and challenges will become available to you along the way.

Press "__CONTROL__menu-search-open__" to open the search box and type in the item name and press "ENTER" to save the search term. You can then press "__CONTROL__menu-search-get-next__" to run the search on almost any menu. In some menus you can also search backwards by pressing "__CONTROL__menu-search-get-last__".

tutorial-chapter-9-step-4-header=Copy pasting machine settings
tutorial-chapter-9-step-4-detail=You can copy paste settings such as assembling machine recipes or building filters so that you do not hav configure them every time. You can copy the settings of a selected machine by pressing "__CONTROL__copy-entity-settings-info__" on it and paste the settings on another machine by pressing "__CONTROL__paste-entity-settings-info__" on it.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-5-header=Belt fullness reflects production issues
tutorial-chapter-9-step-5-detail=In general, if you aim to have more machines filling a belt than emptying it, you can expect the belt to usually be full. This is useful for identifying belts quickly, and also any empty belt would be a sign to indicate a production problem.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-6-header=Leave extra space
tutorial-chapter-9-step-6-detail=There is usually plenty of building space that you can find or create easily. Aim to leave at least 10 tiles of space between different production areas since you never know when you might need to pass a new belt through an area.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-7-header=Rebuilding is normal
tutorial-chapter-9-step-7-detail=It is a normal part of Factorio to pick up all the buildings in an area and build something new and better. This is a great solution when you are feeling stuck.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-8-header=Instant mining tool
tutorial-chapter-9-step-8-detail=You can clear a large number of buildings using the instant mining tool. Press "CONTROL + X" to take it in hand and press "__CONTROL__clear-cursor__" to remove it. In this mode every building the cursor touches is instantly mined. You can also instantly area mine every building within 10 tiles of the cursor by pressing "__CONTROL__mine-area__" while this tool is in hand. In contrast, area mining without the tool in hand will only target obstacles such as trees and rocks and items on the ground.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-9-header=Machines take only what they need
tutorial-chapter-9-step-9-detail=You may have noticed that inserters do not try to completely fill up building input slots. The rule they use is to gather enough input ingredients for two more crafting cycles but not more, so that the majority of materials can remain on the belt or in the chest in front of the inserter for other inserters to use. The same applies to inserters refueling machines, except for trains.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-10-header=Production has ratios
tutorial-chapter-9-step-10-detail=It is feasible to use any number of machines that you want for any task, but in general there are numerical limits and ratios to help guide things. For example, three assembling machines making copper cable are precisely enough for supplying two assembling machines making electronic circuits.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-11-header=Power management
tutorial-chapter-9-step-11-detail=It is a good idea to keep track of your power grid. Examining any electric pole will report how its power grid is doing. Low power will slow down machines but they will keep on working, although if your coal mining drills slow down too much they might not be able to catch up with the demand from your boilers and you will have to disconnect part of your factory until your coal supply is restored.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-12-header=Warnings menu
tutorial-chapter-9-step-12-detail=You can press "__CONTROL__open-warnings-menu__" to open the warnings menu. In addition to check machine statuses, this menu can identify some factory problems for you.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-13-header=Mall building
tutorial-chapter-9-step-13-detail=While producing science packs is the main goal of a factory, it is also a good idea to make the factory also produce items and buildings for you to use yourself, like assembling machines making assembling machines for you. You can dedicate some output chests or a design an area for this. The community likes to call these areas "malls" or "hubs".

tutorial-chapter-9-step-14-header=Lab chaining
tutorial-chapter-9-step-14-detail=Research labs have a handy feature where an inserter can take any science pack from one lab and put it in another. You can use this idea to make a simple chain of labs, where only the first one needs to be supplied from a belt or a chest.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-15-header=Chest slot locking
tutorial-chapter-9-step-15-detail=Chest inventories have a special feature where you can lock slots, starting from the last one and up until the first one, using "PAGE UP" or "PAGE DOWN". Locked slots can be emptied by inserters as usual, but they cannot be filled by inserters. Therefore you can limit how much a chest can be filled, and thus how much it drains your factory resources.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-16-header=Transport belt lanes
tutorial-chapter-9-step-16-detail=Transport belts have two lanes, and inserters prioritize the lanes using specific rules. When you split or merge or sideload belts, lanes interact in specific ways. You can safely ignore the lanes when you use only one type of item for each belt. Learning and using lane management later on can allow you to reliably transport two types of items on each belt instead of one, or to use the full capacity of a belt when high item traffic is needed.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-17-header=Check a building's  status
tutorial-chapter-9-step-17-detail=You can check a building's current status and some other stats like its health level by pressing "__CONTROL__read-entity-status__" on it. This will help with figuring out any issues with your production.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-18-header=Area scanning
tutorial-chapter-9-step-18-detail=Area scanning allows you to analyze a specific square area around your cursor. To use it, press "__CONTROL__toggle-cursor__" to toggle Cursor Mode and then press "__CONTROL__cursor-size-increment__" and "__CONTROL__cursor-size-decrement__" to change the cursor size. For cursor sizes greater than 1 the cursor reports all the found entities within its area. You can press "DIRECTION KEYS" to move the cursor by its size for each press and scan a new area every time, or you can press "ARROW KEYS" to move the cursor by only 1 tile at any cursor size. You can then press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-distance-and-direction__" to get the relative position of the cursor box.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-19-header=Directional scanning
tutorial-chapter-9-step-19-detail=If you want to examine entities in a specific direction only, you can press "__CONTROL__scan-facing-direction__" to scan the direction you are facing, which is the direction of the cursor from you when you press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-distance-and-direction__". In addition to entities strictly in that direction, diagonally located entities within 10 tiles are indexed as well.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-20-header=Chunk charting
tutorial-chapter-9-step-20-detail=The scanner tool is limited by how much of the world has been charted. You can chart more areas at the edge of your map by walking to them, or by using radars, which will scan nearby tiles instantly and further tiles slowly. You need to chart every location only once, for the scanner to model the topography.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-21-header=Combat
tutorial-chapter-9-step-21-detail=While it was not mentioned so far, depending on the planet you landed on, you might need to worry about enemies in the area. It is a good idea to produce bullets and research basic military technologies just in case.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-22-header=More info at the wiki
tutorial-chapter-9-step-22-detail=While the basics are covered here, there are several more features and tricks and shortcuts that you can find on the Factorio Access Wiki.
