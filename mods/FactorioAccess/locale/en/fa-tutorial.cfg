#--Chapter 0-- Length: 3 (organized differently)
tutorial-chapter-0-header-1=Tutorial system navigation
tutorial-chapter-0-message-1=Tutorial system, press "__CONTROL__help-read__" to hear the current step or press "__CONTROL__help-get-other__" to read its summary. Press "__CONTROL__help-next__" to go forward and "__CONTROL__help-back__" to go back.

tutorial-chapter-0-header-2=Keyboard warning about square brackets
tutorial-chapter-0-message-2=Keyboard warning: An important key is "LEFT BRACKET" and your system reads it out as "__CONTROL__leftbracket-key-id__". Similarly, another important key is "RIGHT BRACKET" and your system reads it out as "__CONTROL__rightbracket-key-id__". You may want to adjust your reader settings to include square brackets, and if your system reads a different key name entirely, you can expect these two keys to be located to the right of your "P" key.

tutorial-chapter-0-header-3=About saving
tutorial-chapter-0-message-3=The game automatically saves every few minutes. You can also press "__CONTROL__save-game-manually__" to trigger an autosave manually.

tutorial-chapter-0-header-4=About pausing and closing menus
tutorial-chapter-0-message-4=The game can be paused and unpaused by pressing "__CONTROL__pause-game-fa__" when no game menus are open. If a menu is open, pressing the "__CONTROL__pause-game-fa__" key will instead exit the menu. Pausing in singleplayer mode will pause all game sounds as well.

#tutorial-chapter-0-message-X=Steps are grouped into chapters, and you can use "__CONTROL__help-chapter-next__" or "__CONTROL__help-chapter-back__" to jump between chapters. 

#tutorial-chapter-0-message-X=Steps within the chapters also have summaries, and you can toggle between reading full steps or summaries by pressing "__CONTROL__help-toggle-header-mode__".


#--Chapter 1-- Length: ***
tutorial-chapter-1-step-1-header=Chapter 1, Welcome to Nauvis, you need iron
tutorial-chapter-1-step-1-detail=Chapter 1, Welcome to Nauvis, you need iron

tutorial-chapter-1-step-2-header=Status report: You need iron
tutorial-chapter-1-step-2-detail=You have survived the landing unharmed but your spaceship is completely wrecked. You will need to build a new rocket from scratch to get back to space. This will require plenty of resources and specialized buildings to process them. But to do any of that, you first need to acquire some iron.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-3-header=Walking around in telestep
tutorial-chapter-1-step-3-detail=You can walk around by pressing "__CONTROL__move-up__", "__CONTROL__move-left__", "__CONTROL__move-down__", "__CONTROL__move-right__", with the north direction being "__CONTROL__move-up__". As you walk, the cursor system will identify the terrain or the entity in front of you. When you press a new direction, you will only turn to the new direction on the first press, and you will take steps on the later presses. 

tutorial-chapter-1-step-4-header=Coordinate system
tutorial-chapter-1-step-4-detail=The coordinate system has been established with your crash site at point 0,0. You can check your cursor coordinate by pressing "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__". Walking East will increase the X coordinate and walking South will increase the Y coordinate. 1 unit forward means 1 tile forward, which is about 1 meter of distance.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-5-header=Walk among the spaceship wreckage
tutorial-chapter-1-step-5-detail=The main part of your crashed spaceship is just north of point 0,0. The smaller spaceship wreck pieces are mostly to your west around the coordinates of -20, 0. Try to walk over to one of them. 

tutorial-chapter-1-step-6-header=Reading entity descriptions
tutorial-chapter-1-step-6-detail=When you find an object or entity with your cursor, it reports some relevant information about the selected entity, such as whether a spaceship wreck piece you found contains any items such as iron plates. You can also press "__CONTROL__item-info__" to read the description for the selected entity. 

tutorial-chapter-1-step-7-header=Find a wreck piece
tutorial-chapter-1-step-7-detail=Walk among the spaceship wreck pieces to find one that is reported contain items such as iron plates.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-8-header=Fast item collection
tutorial-chapter-1-step-8-detail=Spaceship wreck pieces can be regarded as containers that hold salvagable items. You can quickly empty the output of a selected entity by pressing "__CONTROL__fast-entity-transfer-info__". Empty out a wreck piece or two now.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-9-header=Open player inventory
tutorial-chapter-1-step-9-detail=Items you collect are held in your own inventory. You can open or close this menu by pressing "__CONTROL__open-inventory__". Inventory menus such as this one are represented by rows of slots that can hold items in stacks of various sizes.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-10-header=Inventory navigation
tutorial-chapter-1-step-10-detail=In most menus, you can press "__CONTROL__move-up__", "__CONTROL__move-left__", "__CONTROL__move-down__", "__CONTROL__move-right__" to navigate between slots or menu lines. Going over the edge of an inventory will wrap around to the other side. For inventory menus you can also press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" to check the currently selected slot's position. Explore the items in your inventory, including the iron plates you might have just picked up and other items you had grabbed while evacuating the ship.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-11-header=Inventory item descriptions
tutorial-chapter-1-step-11-detail=For a selected item stack in the inventory, you can press "__CONTROL__item-info__" to read its description. Some items are buildings and so their description begin by specifying their dimensions when they are placed down. Examine the items you have now, before closing the inventory.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-12-header=Cursor Mode part 1
tutorial-chapter-1-step-12-detail=There might be more wreck pieces around with iron to salvage. However, it is inefficient to navigate yourself around one object to find the others, so it is useful to control the cursor independently while your character stands still. This can be done in Cursor Mode. 

tutorial-chapter-1-step-13-header=Cursor Mode part 2
tutorial-chapter-1-step-13-detail=Press "__CONTROL__toggle-cursor__" to toggle Cursor Mode on or off. In this mode, the cursor moves by one tile every time you press a walking direction key or an arrow key. The detached cursor can move infinitely far away but most cursor based interactions with an entity require for it to be within your reaching distance, which is about 10 tiles.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-14-header=Cursor Mode part 3
tutorial-chapter-1-step-14-detail=Press "__CONTROL__return-cursor-to-player__" to return the cursor back to you. Press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" to read the cursor coordinates as usual, or press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-distance-and-direction__" to get the cursor's relative distance and direction from you.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-15-header=Use cursor mode to explore
tutorial-chapter-1-step-15-detail=Use cursor mode to further explore the crash site and collect any items you find from the wreck pieces by pressing "__CONTROL__fast-entity-transfer-info__" as before.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-16-header=Entity scanner tool part 1
tutorial-chapter-1-step-16-detail=While cursor mode makes movement faster, trying to find anything by chance is still not efficient. Therefore you can instead use your entity scanner tool. When you run a scan with it, it creates a snapshot of all the entities around you at that moment and creates an information list about them, including their positions.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-17-header=Entity scanner tool part 2
tutorial-chapter-1-step-17-detail=You can run a scan by pressing "__CONTROL__rescan__". This sorts the scan results list by distance from your character's current position. Individual distances to objects update automatically as you move, but to reorder the list according to a new reference position requires pressing "__CONTROL__scan-sort-by-distance__". Run a scan now.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-18-header=Entity scanner tool part 3
tutorial-chapter-1-step-18-detail=To navigate the scan results list, press "__CONTROL__scan-list-up__" and "__CONTROL__scan-list-down__".Press "__CONTROL__scan-list-middle__" to repeat the selected entry. Reading a list entry makes your cursor jump to that entity, and so you can explore around it using Cursor Mode. You can also read its description by pressing "__CONTROL__item-info-last-indexed__". Explore the scan list now.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-19-header=Entity scanner tool part 4
tutorial-chapter-1-step-19-detail=If two entities have the same name and properties, such as two small spaceship wreck pieces with iron plates in them, then they get listed in the same scanner list entry. This ensures that every new scanner list line is a new kind of entity. To switch between different instances of the same entity, you can press "__CONTROL__scan-selection-up__" or "__CONTROL__scan-selection-down__". You can use this to find individual spaceship wreck pieces if you want.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-20-header=Explore the spaceship wreck a little more
tutorial-chapter-1-step-20-detail=Test the scanner for a few minutes while you locate more spaceship wreck pieces, if any, and salvage from them.

tutorial-chapter-1-step-21-header=Navigation basics complete
tutorial-chapter-1-step-21-detail=You now have some salvaged iron to use, and the basics of navigation in the world and in inventories have been covered. However, you will need much more iron to do just about anything. Luckily, there appears to be iron ore found large patches across the surface, and so it is now time for some mining and smelting.


#--Chapter 2-- Length: ***
tutorial-chapter-2-step-1-header=Chapter 2, mining and smelting
tutorial-chapter-2-step-1-detail=Chapter 2, mining and smelting

tutorial-chapter-2-step-2-header=Scan for iron ore
tutorial-chapter-2-step-2-detail=Run the scanner and go through the scan results to find iron ore.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-3-header=Scan list category filters
tutorial-chapter-2-step-3-detail=To make the scan results list less crowded, you can filter it to include only a specific category of entities. Switch your filter categories by pressing "__CONTROL__scan-category-up__" or "__CONTROL__scan-category-down__". For example, when scanning for iron ore, you can switch to the scanner category of "Resources".

tutorial-chapter-2-step-4-header=Walk over to the iron ore patch
tutorial-chapter-2-step-4-header=Walk over to the iron ore patch. You can keep pressing "__CONTROL__scan-list-middle__" to keep track of its position as you walk.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-5-header=Smooth walking mode
tutorial-chapter-2-step-5-detail=An alternate to the current telestep walking mode is smooth walking mode, where pressing a direction key makes you immediately turn and run towards the relevant direction for as long as you hold down the key. Press "__CONTROL__toggle-walk__" to toggle your walking mode. While smooth walking, you are no longer locked to the coordinate grid and you can also run diagonally. Also in this mode, the cursor does not read the terrain of tiles in front of you. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-6-header=Mining iron ore
tutorial-chapter-2-step-6-detail=Once you have reached the iron ore patch, you can mine a selected ore tile by holding down "__CONTROL__mine-access-sounds__". It takes some time but the ore slowly buiilds up in your inventory. Mine 10 units of iron ore.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-7-header=Ore needs to smelted
tutorial-chapter-2-step-7-detail=The ore needs to be smelted in a furnace for it to be usable. You should have a small furnace unit in your inventory, among the emergency equipment you grabbed while evacuating the ship. Press "__CONTROL__open-inventory__" to open your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-8-header=Grab your furnace
tutorial-chapter-2-step-8-detail=Find the stone furnace in your inventory using the direction keys. You can take it in hand by pressing "__CONTROL__click-menu__" and then press "__CONTROL__close-menu-access__" to close the inventory. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-9-header=About items in hand
tutorial-chapter-2-step-9-detail=Your hand is attached to your cursor and it can hold one item stack. You can read what it is holding by pressing "__CONTROL__read-hand__" and you can empty your hand into your inventory by pressing "__CONTROL__pipette-tool-info__". Try now to put away the furnace and grab it again.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-10-header=Building previews from hand
tutorial-chapter-2-step-10-detail=If the stack in hand contains buildings, you can place them to build them. While your hand hovers over a tile, the cursor sometimes reports preview info about trying to place the building there. You can get additional preview info by pressing "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__". 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-11-header=Build the furnace
tutorial-chapter-2-step-11-detail=With the furnace in hand, walk 4 or 5 tiles into the ore patch and place down the furnace by pressing "__CONTROL__click-hand__". If you want to pick it back up later, you can mine it by holding down "__CONTROL__mine-access-sounds__". Mining it returns the furnace item to your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-12-header=Building status part 1
tutorial-chapter-2-step-12-detail=The furnace is now on the ground as a 2 by 2 building. You can check the status of any building by pressing "__CONTROL__read-entity-status__" on it. Check the furnace status now.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-13-header=Building status part 3
tutorial-chapter-2-step-13-detail=The furnace reports being out of fuel or raw materials. This is obvious right now since we are going to fill it up, but generally it is useful to check the status of a building to understand what is going on with it.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-14-header=Building menus part 1
tutorial-chapter-2-step-14-detail=You can open the menu of a building such as a furnace by pressing "__CONTROL__click-entity__". For most buildings, the menu is divided into multiple sectors, with each sector having its own inventory and its own purpose. You can review the currently opened menu and sector by pressing "__CONTROL__read-menu-name__".

tutorial-chapter-2-step-15-header=Building menus part 2
tutorial-chapter-2-step-15-detail=You can switch between sectors using "__CONTROL__switch-menu-or-gun__" and "__CONTROL__reverse-switch-menu-or-gun__". Switching to a new sector announces its name and how many slots its inventory has. One of the sectors for every building is the player inventory, available for convenience but with fewer features than usual. You can close the building menu by pressing "__CONTROL__close-menu-access__". 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-16-header=Add ore to a furnace
tutorial-chapter-2-step-16-detail=To get the furnace working, you will need to add the iron ore and some fuel. From the player inventory sector you can grab the iron ore stack into hand by pressing "__CONTROL__click-menu__". Then switch to the furnace input sector using "__CONTROL__switch-menu-or-gun__" and put down the stack in hand by pressing "__CONTROL__click-menu__". 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-17-header=Take solid fuel in hand
tutorial-chapter-2-step-17-detail=Now the furnace will need fuel to burn. You have some solid fuel among your emergency supplies, so you can use some of that. Find the solid fuel from your inventory and take it in hand. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-18-header=Smart drop the solid fuel
tutorial-chapter-2-step-18-detail=While you can insert all of the solid fuel into the furace, you will need some of it later. Therefore a different technique can be used for inserting it. Close all menus but keep the fuel in hand. Find the furnace with the cursor and press "__CONTROL__drop-cursor-info__" to do a smart drop. This will smart insert only one unit from the stack in hand into the appropriate sector of the selected building.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-19-header=Smart drop the solid fuel
tutorial-chapter-2-step-19-detail=Press "__CONTROL__drop-cursor-info__" over the furnace two more times. This will have 3 units inserted in total and the furnace should now be working, which is audible from its crackling sounds. 3 solid fuel units will be enough to smelt a full stack of 100 iron plates.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-20-header=Examine the working furnace
tutorial-chapter-2-step-20-detail=Examine the working furnace status and its sectors. Some of the input and fuel should have disappeared into the building while it is working. After some time, the processed output appears at the output sector. Every building continues working without stopping until it runs into an issue, such as missing inputs or full outputs. Furnaces burn fuel efficiently such that one unit of any fuel can be used for multiple smelting cycles, and when a furnace gets interrupted, a partially burned fuel item's remaining energy is stored without being wasted. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-21-header=Collect iron plates
tutorial-chapter-2-step-21-detail=Collect iron plates from the output sector of the furnace. You will need to mine more ore if you want to keep this furnace going, but you can use mining drills to do this for you.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-22-header=Mining drills
tutorial-chapter-2-step-22-detail=You also had a fuel-powered burner mining drill as part of your emergency equipment. You can set up this mining drill in such a way that it directly mines and drops ore into the furnace. This is more easily done in Cursor Mode.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-23-header=Building in Cursor Mode part 1
tutorial-chapter-2-step-23-detail=Open your inventory with "__CONTROL__open-inventory__" and grab the burner mining drill with "__CONTROL__click-menu__". Close the inventory by pressing "__CONTROL__close-menu-access__" and then enable Cursor Mode by pressing "__CONTROL__toggle-cursor__". This will make the build preview move around with the cursor while you stand still.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-24-header=Building in Cursor Mode part 2
tutorial-chapter-2-step-24-detail= The drill in hand is a 2 by 2 building, like the furnace on the ground. In Cursor Mode, a building is always held by its northwest corner (or its top left corner). This fact can be used to align buildings, as will be demonstrated now.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-25-header=Building in Cursor Mode part 3
tutorial-chapter-2-step-25-detail= With the drill in hand, move the cursor to the northwest corner of the furnace on the ground. You can check the selected part of the furnace by pressing "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__". This info will also report that the drill in hand is 2 by 2, meaning that it is directly over the furnace now.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-26-header=Building in Cursor Mode part 3
tutorial-chapter-2-step-26-detail=Press any direction key twice and then press "__CONTROL__click-hand__" to place. The drill has now moved 2 tiles and should now be placed wall to wall with the furnace. Note that the placement area needs to have some iron ore beneath it for this to work.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-27-header=Examine the mining drill
tutorial-chapter-2-step-27-detail=Examine the mining drill by opening its menu. Note that it does not have any input or output sectors. This is because mining drills collect inputs directly from the ore tiles below them and they eject their outputs directly from their output chutes, which face the same direction as the drills. If there is a container or a furnace in front of the output chute, then the drill fills it up. If nothing is in front of the output chute, then the ore falls to the ground and clogs the output chute. 

tutorial-chapter-2-step-28-header=Rotate the mining drill
tutorial-chapter-2-step-28-detail=Based on mining drill properties explained, the drill placed down earlier needs to be rotated to face the furnace. Select the drill with the cursor and press "__CONTROL__rotate-building__" or "__CONTROL__reverse-rotate-building__" to rotate it to the correct direction. For example, if the furnace is located at the west of the drill, then the drill needs to face the west.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-29-header=Refuel the drill
tutorial-chapter-2-step-29-detail=The correctly rotated drill needs to be refueled. Grab solid fuel from your inventory as before and smart drop 4 units into the drill by pressing "__CONTROL__drop-cursor-info__" over it.

tutorial-chapter-2-step-30-header=Now iron is automated
tutorial-chapter-2-step-30-detail=Now that the drill and the furnace are both working, you now have an automatic supply of iron plates. However, you will run out of solid fuel soon and so you will need to start mining coal to keep your machines running.


#--Chapter 3-- Length: ***
tutorial-chapter-3-step-1-header=Chapter 3, Get coal and get crafting
tutorial-chapter-3-step-1-detail=Chapter 3, Get coal and get crafting

tutorial-chapter-3-step-2-header=Coal sources
tutorial-chapter-3-step-2-detail=Coal is an ideal fuel source. It has one third of the energy of solid fuel but it is abundant and can be used without processing. Like iron ore, coal can be mined from patches by hand or by using drills. It can also be found inside huge rocks that can be found across the surface. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-3-header=About fast travel
tutorial-chapter-3-step-3-detail=Before leaving your machines to go find coal, note that you will need to return to the iron ore patch several times. Therefore it would be good to set up a fast travel point here. You can set up fast travel points as reference points with descriptions, and you are also able to teleport to them using your mini teleporter tool.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-header=Create a fast travel point
tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-detail=Open the fast travel menu by pressing "__CONTROL__open-fast-travel-menu__" and follow the instructions to create a point near the furnace.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-header=Test the fast travel point
tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-detail=Test your fast travel point by walking a few steps away and opening the fast travel menu again with "__CONTROL__open-fast-travel-menu__", and then selecting the point and pressing "__CONTROL__click-menu__" to travel to it.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-header=Locate huge rocks
tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-detail=Now you are ready to search for huge rocks using the scanner tool. To recap on the scanner controls, you run a scan by pressing "__CONTROL__rescan__", and navigate the list with "__CONTROL__scan-list-up__" and "__CONTROL__scan-list-down__", or press "__CONTROL__scan-list-middle__" to reread. You can also switch your filter categories by pressing "__CONTROL__scan-category-up__" or "__CONTROL__scan-category-down__". 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-5-header=Teleporting
tutorial-chapter-3-step-5-detail=While you can walk to distant objects, the teleporter tool can also be used at any time to teleport to the cursor location by pressing "__CONTROL__teleport-to-cursor__". When you combine this feature with the scan list making the cursor jump to indexed entities, it means that you can simply teleport to any entity after finding it with the scanner.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-6-header=Find a huge rock
tutorial-chapter-3-step-6-detail=Walk or teleport to a huge rock. Make sure it is not simply a big rock, because only huge rocks contain coal. If you cannot find any huge rocks, you can mine coal from a coal patch instead.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-6-header=Mine huge rocks
tutorial-chapter-3-step-6-detail=Mine the rock by holding "__CONTROL__mine-access-sounds__". Now use the scanner to locate another one and repeat this process until you have at least one stack each of coal and stone, which means at least 80 units each. If you cannot find more rocks, use the coal or stone patches instead.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-7-header=Return to your iron area
tutorial-chapter-3-step-7-detail=Use the fast travel menu to return to your furnace and miner and collect iron plates from the furnace output sector. Next, open the building menus with "__CONTROL__click-entity__" and make sure to take out any remaining solid fuel from the buildings, and press "__CONTROL__pipette-tool-info__" to put the solid fuel into your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-8-header=Refuel the furnace with coal
tutorial-chapter-3-step-8-detail=Now that you have a fair amount of coal, you can use it instead, and insert larger amounts too. Take coal in hand from the inventory and hover it over the furnace like before. This time press "__CONTROL__fast-entity-split__". This will smart drop half of the stack in hand into the machine, which is 25 coal.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-8-header=Refuel the drill with coal
tutorial-chapter-3-step-8-detail=Read the stack in hand by pressing "__CONTROL__read-hand__" and note that the stack has been refilled using other coal stacks from the inventory. This is a feature of smart inserting. Now hover the cursor over the mining drill and drop a whole stack of coal into it by pressing "__CONTROL__fast-entity-transfer__". And with that, all three types of smart dropping have been covered.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-9-header=First crafting goals
tutorial-chapter-3-step-9-detail=With the fuel top up, you will soon have enough iron to craft many machines. You can begin to craft your first machines now, which will be new furnaces and new mining drills so that coal mining can be automated.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-10-header=Crafting menu part 1
tutorial-chapter-3-step-10-detail=The crafting menu is one of the player menus. You can open this menu by pressing "__CONTROL__open-inventory__" to open the player inventory menu and then pressing "__CONTROL__switch-menu-or-gun__" to switch to the crafting menu. This menu is similar to an inventory, but all its slots contain crafting recipes instead of item stacks.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-10-header=Crafting menu part 2
tutorial-chapter-3-step-10-detail=Crafting recipes are grouped into four item categories. You can switch category by pressing "__CONTROL__move-up__" or "__CONTROL__move-down__" and you can navigate the recipes within a category by pressing "__CONTROL__move-left__" or "__CONTROL__move-right__". Navigate to the "production" category and find the stone furnace recipe. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-10-header=Crafting menu part 3
tutorial-chapter-3-step-10-detail=For a selected recipe in the crafting menu, you can read the recipe ingredients and products by pressing "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__", or the raw ingredient names using "__CONTROL__read-cursor-distance-and-direction__", or you can read the product item description by pressing "__CONTROL__item-info__". Check the stone furnace recipe info now.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-10-header=Crafting menu part 4
tutorial-chapter-3-step-10-detail=You can craft 1 set of a selected crafting recipe by pressing "__CONTROL__click-menu__" and you can craft 5 units by pressing "__CONTROL__crafting-5__". Use these keys to craft 8 stone furnaces. The orders get added to your crafting queue while your character works on them.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-12-header=Manual crafting perks part 1
tutorial-chapter-3-step-12-detail=Next in the crafting menu, find burner mining drills within the "production" category. Press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" to check the ingredients needed. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-12-header=Manual crafting perks part 2
tutorial-chapter-3-step-12-detail=Note that the recipe includes stone furnaces that you already crafted, and iron gear wheels that you do not have. When you order to craft the drill, the crafting queue automatically adds iron gear wheel sets so that it can use them to make drills, and the queue automatically takes existing stone furnaces to save time. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-12-header=Craft 5 burner mining drills.
tutorial-chapter-3-step-12-detail=Craft 5 burner mining drills. You should have 3 stone furnaces left. 

...

tutorial-chapter-3-step-13-header=Self-feeding coal supply part 1
tutorial-chapter-3-step-13-detail=Now that you have extra mining drills, you can use some to mine coal. Head over to the coal patch and place down a drill near the middle.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-14-header=Self-feeding coal supply part 2
tutorial-chapter-3-step-14-detail=Now use cursor mode to place down a second mining drill aligned wall to wall with the first. Then rotate both drills to face each other and add 1 piece of coal to each. Because they are both mining coal, the drills will output into each other's fuel slots and keep each other running as long as there is space to drop the coal. You can then collect the coal from both at any time. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-15-header=Start smelting copper
tutorial-chapter-3-step-15-detail=With iron and coal solved for now, you can move onto other resources like copper. You will need a fair amount of copper later on so it is a good idea to set up one drill feeding one furnace at the nearest copper ore patch. Use the same arrangements as before for iron and perhaps set up fast travel points for each area. Make sure to refuel the machines from time to time.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-16-header=Find trees with area scanning
tutorial-chapter-3-step-16-detail=Your next required resource is wood. You can locate forests from the scanner tool and chop down trees to get wood. Trees do not grow back but you do not need that much wood anyway. Travel over to the nearest forest now. Within a forest, trees are nearby but not necessarily easy to find. You can use Cursor Mode to find them, especially using Area Scanning Mode. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-17-header=Area scanning
tutorial-chapter-3-step-17-detail=To use area scanning, press "__CONTROL__toggle-cursor__" to toggle Cursor Mode. You can then press "__CONTROL__cursor-size-increment__" and "__CONTROL__cursor-size-decrement__" to change the cursor size. For cursor sizes greater than 1 the cursor reports all the found entities within its area. Use this to find trees. You can press "DIRECTION KEYS" to move the cursor by its size for each press, or you can press "ARROW KEYS" to move the cursor by only 1 tile at any size. You can then press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-distance-and-direction__" to get the relative position of the cursor box and walk over to it.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-18-header=Area mining
tutorial-chapter-3-step-18-detail=A faster alternative method for clearing trees and also rocks is area mining. When youı press "__CONTROL__mine-area__" on a tree or a rock or an empty tile, this will quickly mine all such entities within 10 tiles of the cursor tile. This is especially useful when these entities are obstructing you from building in an area.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-19-header=Start mining stone
tutorial-chapter-3-step-19-detail=When you have at least one stack of wood, you can move onto automating your stone supply. Place down a mining drill by itself in the middle of the stone patch and add fuel to it. Note that it drops one unit on the ground and then stops due to its output being full. Therefore you need to put a chest in front of it. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-20-header=Stone collection chest
tutorial-chapter-3-step-20-detail=Craft 1 wooden chest from the logistics category and place it where the ground item is, in front of the miner's output chute. The stone is collected in its raw form so that it can be used for crafting more furnaces, but it can also be smelted in a furnace to make stone bricks that you can pave the floor with.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-21-header=Chests
tutorial-chapter-3-step-21-detail=Chests are useful because they have many output slots instead of one, and mining drills can drop directly into them. Chests are identified by the scanner according to the item they contain if there is only one type.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-22-header=Ready to scale up
tutorial-chapter-3-step-22-detail=Now you have prepared at least 1 machine each for producing coal, iron plates, copper plates, and raw stone. You can consider this as your first factory, ready to help you make a bigger and better factory. Your next steps should be to set up some more pairs of iron miners and furnaces, because you will still need stacks and stacks full of iron. Along the way, consider using some keyboard shortcuts, which will now be introduced.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-1-header=Chapter 4, Scaling up and shortcuts
tutorial-chapter-3-step-1-detail=Chapter 4, Scaling up and shortcuts

tutorial-chapter-3-step-2-header=Quickbar shortcuts part 1
tutorial-chapter-3-step-2-detail=The quickbar is a system for you to assign shortcut numbers to instantly get items from your inventory. It is very useful to do this for frequently used items such as coal. To set up a quickbar slot for an item, take it in hand or select from the inventory and press "CONTROL + DIGIT", where the digit could be between 0 and 9 from the keyboard. If you press the same "DIGIT" again, you will now grab that assigned item from your inventory to your hand. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-3-header=Quickbar shortcuts part 2
tutorial-chapter-3-step-3-detail=You can use up to 10 different quickbars. You switch to a different quickbar by pressing "SHIFT + DIGIT", with the digit for your desired quickbar. For your first quickbar, it is very useful to add coal, furnaces, and mining drills.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-header=Smart pipette tool shortcut
tutorial-chapter-3-step-4-detail=The smart pipette tool, or the picker tool, is another shortcut for grabbing items from your inventory. When you select an entity with the cursor, like when looking at a building in front of you, press "__CONTROL__pipette-tool-info__" to use the smart pipette. It will grab from your inventory the item form of this entity, if you have it. Otherwise it will do nothing. For ore on the ground, this tool has an additional shortcut that makes you grab a mining drill instead of ore from your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-5-header=Smart inserting between inventories
tutorial-chapter-3-step-5-detail=There are also smart shortcuts for inserting items into buildings. When working with building menus, when you select an item slot in your inventory, you can press "__CONTROL__transfer-one-stack__" to have the selected item stack instantly transfered into the most appropriate sector of the building. You can use this shortcut to instantly insert ore and coal from your inventory into the correct slot of a furnace. 

tutorial-chapter-3-step-6-header=Smart inserting from the open world.
tutorial-chapter-3-step-6-detail=Smart inserting also works in the open world with an item in hand. If you take coal in hand, like from the quickbar, and then position your cursor over a building such as a drill, you can press "__CONTROL__drop-cursor-info__" to smart insert 1 unit from the hand stack into the building. You can also press "__CONTROL__fast-entity-split-info__" to smart insert half of the hand stack, or "__CONTROL__fast-entity-transfer-info__" to smart insert the whole hand stack. If your inventory has more of the same item in hand, the hand is immediately refilled from the inventory after you do smart inserting.

tutorial-chapter-3-step-7-header=Smart collecting from buildings
tutorial-chapter-3-step-7-detail=When your hand is empty, you can smart collect all of the available output from a cursor selected building by pressing "__CONTROL__fast-entity-transfer-info__". You can also collect just half of the total output by pressing "__CONTROL__fast-entity-split-info__".

tutorial-chapter-3-step-8-header=Scale up complete
tutorial-chapter-3-step-8-detail=Using the shortcuts described earlier, keep crafting and building to make sure you have 4 furnaces making iron plates and 2 furnaces making copper plates and 1 furnace making stone bricks, and a mining drill for each furnace. You will then have enough production for your later goals.


#--Chapter 5-- Length: 15
tutorial-chapter-5-step-1-header=Chapter 4, Belts and inserters
tutorial-chapter-5-step-1-detail=Chapter 4, Belts and inserters

tutorial-chapter-5-step-2-header=Why you need belts and inserters
tutorial-chapter-5-step-2-detail=As you may have realized, it is time consuming to carry coal from the coal mining drills to all the other machines that need it. It is also annoying that the coal mining drills have only one usable slot each and they fill up too quickly. Since you have a good iron supply now, you can build machines to carry coal for you both in and out of buildings, and across the land. The machines you need are transport belts and burner inserters, which you can craft.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-3-header=Craft machines for the coal supply belt
tutorial-chapter-5-step-3-detail=To set up a smarter coal supply using a transport belt system, first craft 15 transport belt units and 10 burner inserters from the logistics category. Also craft at least 5 burner mining drills from the production category. Head to the coal patch when ready to build. First the transport belts will be placed.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-4-header=About transport belts
tutorial-chapter-5-step-4-detail=Transport belts carry items on top of them in the direction they are facing. They do not need an energy source, and items on top of them never fall off. They have two lanes but you can safely ignore them for now, as long as you use only one type of item for each belt, such as coal-only belt.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-5-header=Pick the coal supply belt direction
tutorial-chapter-5-step-5-detail=Go to the middle of the coal ore patch and use the scanner to find the general direction of your iron ore patch. Let's say it is at the Northwest. In that case face the north or the west. Take a transport belt stack in hand and rotate the stack in hand to also face the same direction as you. Next place down one belt unit. This will mark the direction of your coal supply belt.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-6-header=Place belt units
tutorial-chapter-5-step-6-detail=Move on top of the belt unit and place another unit in the same direction. Repeat this until you reach the edge of the coal patch. With all belt units aligned in a line, you now have one long belt ready to carry coal for you. The belt does not require fuel or anything else to work, so this part of the system is good to go. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-7-header=Place a drill along the belt
tutorial-chapter-5-step-7-detail=Now you can place a burner mining drill on the side of the transport belt, somewhere near the middle of its length. Make sure that the drill faces the belt and put some coal into it. Its coal output will drop directly onto the belt, making the coal ready to go and supply your machines located along this belt. The first machine that needs supplying will be the drill itself. This will be achieved using burner inserters.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-8-header=About burner inserters
tutorial-chapter-5-step-8-detail=An inserter is a machine that can smart collect an item from a building that is directly in front of it and then smart insert the item into a building that is directly behind it. Burner inserters work using fuel, and they can directly use the coal from their own hands to keep themselves running. In contrast, regular inserters do not need fuel but they need electric power, which can be set up later.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-9-header=Place the first burner inserter
tutorial-chapter-5-step-9-detail=A pair of burner inserters will be used to first pick up coal from the belt and then place it into the drill. Two inserters are needed since one inserter cannot load or unload sideways. Place the first burner inserter 2 tiles along the belt from the mining drill so that there is 1 tile of space between the two machines.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-10-header=Place the second burner inserter
tutorial-chapter-5-step-10-detail=When you rotate the first inserter to face the belt, it will take coal from the belt and put it on the ground behind it. Next, place the second burner inserter between the coal on the ground and the burner mining drill. This will require having the one tile gap mentioned earlier. When the second inserter faces the coal on the ground, it can take from that spot and feed the mining drill. Therefore you have a system where the drill drops coal onto the belt and the inserters use some of that coal to feed themselves and the mining drill, while the rest of the coal is free to travel along the belt to other places. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-11-header=Copy the inserter setup
tutorial-chapter-5-step-11-detail=Repeat the pattern described earlier to place more inserters and burner mining drills along the coal belt. Use cursor mode so that you do not need to walk around the machines so much, and aim for at least 3 drills set up on both sides. This will fill up the belt quite well after a few seconds of pause while the machines first fuel up themselves. You can later prepare for extending this coal supply belt further towards the iron ore patch. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-12-header=Prepare to extend the belt
tutorial-chapter-5-step-12-detail=Craft at least 20 more belt units. Then stand on top of the stopping end of the coal supply belt and grab more belts in hand. Note that while the belt moves items, you will not be moved by it. Make sure to turn Cursor Mode off because now you will use Build Lock Mode. You may also want to use telestep walking, which you can toggle by pressing "__CONTROL__toggle-walk__".

tutorial-chapter-5-step-13-header=Use build lock mode to extend the belt
tutorial-chapter-5-step-13-detail=Press "__CONTROL__toggle-build-lock__" to use Build Lock mode, which makes you place down buildings behind you as you walk. For transport belts with Cursor Mode disabled, changing your direction while you walk will also turn the belt direction being placed under you. Use this mode to easily extend the belt by a few tiles. Use the scanner to keep track of where the iron ore patch is and walk towards it. Build lock mode will remain active until you empty your hand or toggle another mode. 

tutorial-chapter-5-step-14-header=Finishing the coal supply belt
tutorial-chapter-5-step-14-detail=Extend the coal supply belt until you reach the iron ore patch. At the end of the belt place a burner inserter and use it to fill up a chest. This will ensure that you have multiple stacks of coal available nearby when you need to feed your iron making furnaces. You can even use some burner inserters to feed your iron ore mining drills and furnaces.

tutorial-chapter-5-step-15-header=Coal supply solved
tutorial-chapter-5-step-15-detail=Now you have a steady supply of resources, especially iron. Using belts and inserters, you also have a smart coal supply to make it much easier to refuel all your iron production machines. You are now ready to do even more automation and prepare to begin research for higher technology. This will first require setting up electricity, using a steam power system.


#--Chapter 6-- Length: 19
tutorial-chapter-6-step-1-header=Chapter 5, Water and power
tutorial-chapter-6-step-1-detail=Chapter 5, Water and power

tutorial-chapter-6-step-2-header=Craft an offshore pump and pipes
tutorial-chapter-6-step-2-detail=Steam power requires a constant water supply, so water will need to be transported to the base area. To do this, craft 1 offshore pump and at least 100 pipes. You will need these to make a long water pipe from the nearest water source, over to the coal patch. Note that you will need copper to make the pump.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-3-header=Go to water
tutorial-chapter-6-step-3-detail=Use the scanner tool to locate the nearest water body. Water can be found in lakes similar to ore being found in patches, but the lakes can be a lot larger and they cannot be walked on. Make your way to the shore. Note that the scanner tool always reports the nearest edge of a large body such as a lake.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-4-header=Place the offshore pump.
tutorial-chapter-6-step-4-detail=Take the offshore pump from your inventory and press "__CONTROL__click-entity__" to run its special building assistant. The assistant will suggest good positions for placing the pump and the first suggestion is usually the nearest good position. Press "__CONTROL__click-menu__" to confirm this. The offshore pump will set up and will fill up with water instantly. It does not need any energy source so it is ready.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-5-header=Starting the water pipe
tutorial-chapter-6-step-5-detail=Take a stack of pipes in hand for transporting the water. Use Cursor Mode and maybe the scanner to locate the pump and then bring the cursor to the tile just next to the pump's output. Press "__CONTROL__click-entity__" to put down a pipe. If it is positioned correctly, the pipe will be full of water. Otherwise it will be empty.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-6-header=Extending the water pipe
tutorial-chapter-6-step-6-detail=Pipes will automatically connect to any neighboring pipes in any of the four main directions. Therefore you can put down more pipes along the first one to make an extended water pipe. You can also walk over pipes. Use the scanner tool to locate the coal patch and use Build Lock Mode to extend the water pipe all the way until just outside the edge of the patch.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-7-header=Crafting steam power machines
tutorial-chapter-6-step-7-detail=Now that you have a water supply, you can craft the buildings needed for steam power. Craft 1 boiler and 2 steam engines using iron plates and stone furnaces. You also need copper and wood now, because you should also craft 1 (regular electric) inserter and at least 1 small power pole.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-8-header=Place the boiler
tutorial-chapter-6-step-8-detail=Take the boiler in hand and use Cursor Mode. The boiler is a 3 by 2 building that has a water pipe along its back, and it has a steam output pipe on its front center. When the boiler is facing north, the water pipe ends are on its southeast and southwest corners, and its steam output is on the middle of its north side. Place it down somwhere near the end of the water pipe so that you can align it by nudging.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-9-header=Nudging buildings
tutorial-chapter-6-step-9-detail=To align buildings that you already placed down, you can nudge them by one tile at a time. This is done by pressing "CONTROL + SHIFT + DIRECTION KEY", where the direction key is "__CONTROL__move-up__" or "__CONTROL__move-left__" or "__CONTROL__move-down__" or "__CONTROL__move-right__". A nudged building can only be nudged into an empty spot. You can use this feature to make sure that the boiler is aligned correctly.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-10-header=Align the boiler
tutorial-chapter-6-step-10-detail=Nudge the boiler to get its back pipe aligned with the end of the water pipe. Any connection will work now but an aligned connection will make future constructions easier. The connected boiler will fill with water, and you can check the building to verify this. Place some coal in the aligned boiler to hear it start working and check that it now has steam in it.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-11-header=About the steam engine
tutorial-chapter-6-step-11-detail=The steam engine is a long building that is 3 by 5 tiles. Both of its short 3 tile sides provide access to a steam pipe that runs through the building and can move steam both in and out of the building. 

tutorial-chapter-6-step-12-header=Placing the steam engine part 1
tutorial-chapter-6-step-12-detail=To precisely place the steam engine, first make sure that the area in front of the boiler is clear for building. Then take the steam engine in hand and enable Cursor Mode. As always, the building is held from its top left corner in Cursor Mode, and when you press "K" to check the preview position, this also reports how far the preview extends to the East and the South.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-13-header=Placing the steam engine part 2
tutorial-chapter-6-step-13-detail=Rotate the steam engine to face the same direction as the boiler. Next, bring the cursor to overlap with the part of the boiler that has the steam output. 

tutorial-chapter-6-step-14-header=Placing the steam engine part 3
tutorial-chapter-6-step-14-detail=If the boiler is facing north, you now need to move 5 tiles north so that the length of the steam engine is covered and the other end is near the boiler output. If the boiler is facing south, you move just 1 tile south so that your end of the engine is near the boiler output. Similarly, you need to move 5 tiles if the boiler is facing west, or just 1 tile if it is facing east. 

tutorial-chapter-6-step-15-header=Placing the steam engine part 4
tutorial-chapter-6-step-15-detail=Next, you need to move the cursor 1 tile sideways so that the middle of the three-tiles-wide boiler and the middle of the three-tiles-wide steam engine are correctly aligned. If the alignment is correct, the steam engine will now fill with steam from the boiler, and you can check the machine to verify this. One boiler can support two steam engines, so you can place your second steam engine at the other end of the first one using the same aligning technique. Use nudging if needed.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-16-header=Testing your steam power system
tutorial-chapter-6-step-16-detail=Now that your boilers and engines are set up, you can test if the electric system works by giving it a load. Place a small electric pole next to each steam engine to create your electric grid. Place your third small electric pole next to the boiler, along its empty wide side, and finally place the electric inserter next the pole and the boiler. This will make your steam engines start to work at very low speed, and you will hear them hissing.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-17-header=Automated boiler fueling
tutorial-chapter-6-step-17-detail=Rotate the inserter that you just placed to face away from the boiler. If you place a chest of coal or a belt of coal in front of this inserter, it can be used to keep the boiler constantly fueled so that your power supply is continuous. Boilers and steam engines work smartly like furnaces such that they never waste any fuel or steam when there is a low power demand.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-18-header=Ready for labs
tutorial-chapter-6-step-18-detail=With your steam power system ready to go, you are finally ready to start using research labs so that you can build more advanced buildings and systems on your way to building a rocket.

tutorial-chapter-6-step-19-header=Quickbar recommendation
tutorial-chapter-6-step-19-detail=In preparation for the next part, consider setting up a quickbar to include coal and belts and many inserter types and also electric poles.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-2-header=Craft 1 research lab
tutorial-chapter-7-step-2-detail=Craft 1 research lab and place it in an empty area near your steam engines.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-3-header=Power the lab
tutorial-chapter-7-step-3-detail=Place a small electric pole near your power network so that you can extend it. Keep extending it towards your lab so that it has power. You can check power pole connection previews in telestep walking mode or Cursor Mode.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-4-header=About research packs
tutorial-chapter-7-step-4-detail=Open the lab to examine its slots. As revealed here, research is done by consuming science packs and electric power at your labs to do experiments. Therefore the main items you need to produce in your factory are the different types of research packs.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-5-header=Craft automation science packs
tutorial-chapter-7-step-5-detail=Craft 10 automation science packs. You will need copper plates and iron gear wheels for this. Place the packs into the lab. The filled and powered lab will begin working when you later select a technology to research.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-6-header=Select to research "automation"
tutorial-chapter-7-step-6-detail= Open the technology menu by pressing "__CONTROL__open-inventory__" to open the inventory and pressing "__CONTROL__switch-menu-or-gun__" multiple times. In this menu, technologies are sorted according to whether they are already researched, available now for research, or locked due to prerequisites. You can change technology categories with "__CONTROL__move-up__" and "__CONTROL__move-down__" and you can navigate within a category with "__CONTROL__move-left__" and "__CONTROL__move-right__". Select the technology named "Automation" and press "__CONTROL__item-info__" to read about it, press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-coords__" to read its science pack requirements, and press "__CONTROL__click-menu__" to start researching it.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-7-header=Research progress
tutorial-chapter-7-step-7-detail=You can hear the electricity crackle as a lab works. You can check the planet's local time and current research progress by pressing "__CONTROL__read-time-and-research-progress__". You will hear the notification sound when the research is complete. Research progress is permanent such that you can interrupt one research to start another and then return to the first one without issues.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-8-header=About assembling machines
tutorial-chapter-7-step-8-detail=Researching "Automation" has unlocked the recipe for assembling machines, which are at the heart of Factorio, because they automate crafting for you. Building a bigger factory requires crafting a lot of parts and the machines to make those parts. Therefore automated crafting at large scales is the solution for getting everything done within reasonable time. Assembling machines are large electric powered crafting machines. They are accessed using inserters and they craft without stopping as long as they have the space and ingredients and power to keep working. 

tutorial-chapter-7-step-9-header=Setting up your first assembling machine
tutorial-chapter-7-step-9-detail=Craft an assembling machine and place it down. The first thing you need to do with it is to set its crafting recipe. Select the automation science pack, and then set up small electric poles to power the machine. The tier 1 assembling machine crafts half as fast as you and it requires exact ingredients to work rather than just raw materials, but you can build any number of them.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-10-header=Parallel crafting with assembling machines 
tutorial-chapter-7-step-10-detail=Now grab some copper plates and drop them into the assembling machine. Craft some iron gear wheels by hand and drop them into the machine too. Next, continue crafting iron gear wheels while the machine makes automation science packs for you. Therefore you are now crafting two things at once.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-11-header=Automate automation science packs: Place machines
tutorial-chapter-7-step-11-detail=Craft a second assembling machine and two inserters. Pick up your first assembling machine by mining it and then place it next to your lab with 1 tile of space. Place the other assembling machine next to the first 1 with again 1 tile of space in between. Configure the second machine to produce iron gear wheels and the first machine to produce automation science packs. 

tutorial-chapter-7-step-12-header=Automate automation science packs: Place inserters
tutorial-chapter-7-step-12-detail=Place one inserter between the two assemblers and another inserter between the science pack assembler and the lab. Rotate the inserters so that the gear assembler feeds the science pack assembler, which feeds the lab. Finally add electric poles and now you are done.

tutorial-chapter-7-step-13-header=Status review
tutorial-chapter-7-step-13-detail=You have a factory that converts metal plates into science! The next goal will be to fully automate your iron supply in an extendable way so that your science production can be fully automated from mine to lab.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-1-detail=Chapter 7, Mass produce iron using belts

tutorial-chapter-8-step-2-header=Research "Logistics"
tutorial-chapter-8-step-2-detail=Select "Logistics" as the next technology to research. This will unlock underground belts, which allow moving short sections of transport belts underground so that they can avoid obstacles or other belts. It also unlocks belt splitters, which are useful machines that allow you to do things like splitting one belt into two belts with the contents divided equally. These machines will be very useful when you start using more belts later.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-3-header=Electric mining drills
tutorial-chapter-8-step-3-detail=While waiting for research, you can scale up your ore production by switching to electric mining drills. Craft 4 of them now. They are twice as fast as burner mining drills, and they can mine a wider area, and they are more energy efficient, and energizing them with electric poles is much easier than refeueling a drill using coal belts and inserters.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-4-header=Create an iron ore belt
tutorial-chapter-8-step-4-detail=Craft 15 transport belts and go to your iron ore patch. Face a direction that has empty space ahead, and place down the belts in a straight line, as before. 

tutorial-chapter-8-step-5-header=Place electric mining drills
tutorial-chapter-8-step-5-detail=Place your electric mining drills along both sides of this belt. They can be wall to wall or with up to 2 spaces in between while they maintain full coverage of the ore around them. Rotate them to face the belt. Then place electric poles around them to supply energy, with every small electric pole able to reach at most 2 drills. This completes the iron ore belt. 

tutorial-chapter-8-step-6-header=First furnace row: Check the space
tutorial-chapter-8-step-6-detail=Next comes mass smelting. Extend the iron ore belt into the empty space beyond the ore patch. Note that this space needs to be at least 10 tiles wide and at least 20 tiles long in order to make the system fit comfortably. You can estimate how much empty space is around you by moving to the middle of your empty space and running the scanner tool. If nearby objects are at least 10 tiles away, that generally means that you have empty space in every direction for at least 10 tiles, and you can easily fit a 10 by 10 factory area there, with you standing at the center point.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-7-header=First furnace row: Place furnaces
tutorial-chapter-8-step-7-detail=Craft 4 stone furnaces and use Cursor Mode to precisely place them in one row along the same side of the belt, with 1 tile of gap space in between each furnace and the belt, and 1 tile of gap space between each furnace and its neighbour. For the purpose of clarity, from now on the parts of the furnaces that face the belt can be considered as their front sides.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-8-header=First furnace row: Place input inserters
tutorial-chapter-8-step-8-detail=Craft 15 belts, 10 inserters and at least 3 electric poles. Place one inserter each in the gap between each furnace and the ore belt, so that inserters feed the fronts of the furnaces from the ore belt. 

tutorial-chapter-8-step-9-header=First furnace row: Place output inserters and belt
tutorial-chapter-8-step-9-detail=Next, place an inserter behind every furnace, to take iron plates out. Create a new transport belt parallel to the first one, but located behind the inserters at the back, so that the inserters will drop iron plates onto this new belt. 

tutorial-chapter-8-step-10-header=First furnace row: Place electric poles 
tutorial-chapter-8-step-10-detail=Now, place electric poles in between neighbouring furnaces so that all the inserters can be powered. In this case it is enough to place a pole in every second gap. You now have an extendable set up for smelting iron ore, except for the problem of refueling the furnaces.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-11-header=First furnace row: Extend the coal belt
tutorial-chapter-8-step-11-detail=You can refuel your row of furnaces by redirecting your iron ore patch's coal belt, since you will not be using the burner machines any more. Extend the belt to make it run directly next to the iron ore belt.

tutorial-chapter-8-step-12-header=First furnace row: Add long handed inserters
tutorial-chapter-8-step-12-detail=Craft 4 long handed inserters and place 1 next to every input inserter, facing the same direction. The long handed inserters take from 2 tiles ahead of them instead of 1 and drop 2 tiles behind instead of 1. In this case they will take from the coal belt and drop into the back sides of the furnaces, but building sides do not matter for any type of inserter interaction. Finally, you have a fully automated furnace row!

tutorial-chapter-8-step-13-header=Row output chests
tutorial-chapter-8-step-13-detail=Now that you are working with rows of machines and belts of items, it is useful to create collection points at the ends of the rows. This can be done by placing an inserter at the side of a belt at the end of the row, and placing a chest behind the inserter. These colleection points can be good fast travel points for collecting items. Consider setting up such an output chest for your furnace row.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-2-detail=You now have an extendable iron plate supply, which is exactly what you need for a growing factory. You need something similar for copper as well, using the electric mining drill and furnace row arrangement just described. Set up the copper ore belt now.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-3-header=Splitting the coal belt
tutorial-chapter-9-step-3-detail=For your copper smelting area, you will need a new coal supply belt. You can create a new belt at your coal patch, but alternatively you can also split your coal supply belt into two using a splitter. Make sure the research of "Logistics" has been completed, and craft 1 splitter. 

tutorial-chapter-9-step-4-header=About splitters
tutorial-chapter-9-step-4-detail=A splitter is a transport belt system machine that is two tiles wide and 1 tile long. It can input two belts from its wide back and output two belts from its wide front, but its narrow sides have no belt access. The splitter works by taking from its input belts at equal speed and distributing to its output belts at equal speed. Therefore you can take one or two input belts, such as coal belts, and split them equally between two output belts.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-5-header=Select the splitting point
tutorial-chapter-9-step-5-detail=Select a point along your coal suppply belt where you want to split it in two. Consider the path a new coal supply belt from your coal patch would need to take to reach your copper patch, and consider how much of this path can overlap with the path you already have to the iron ore patch. The place where the two paths diverge is often the best place for the splitter.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-6-header=Place the splitter
tutorial-chapter-9-step-6-detail=Take the splitter in hand and rotate it to face the same direction as the belt on the ground. Move the cursor over the belt. You can either place the splitter here directly, or you can move it one tile to the side before placing it, depending on whether you want the new belt output to go to the left or the right of the existing belt. Placing the splitter will automatically put the replaced belt unit back into your inventory.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-7-header=Extend the coal belt
tutorial-chapter-9-step-7-detail=Place a belt unit in front of the empty output of the splitter, and your new coal supply belt is ready. Extend this belt until it reaches your planned copper smelting area. While building your new belt, your path might require crossing over obstacles such as another transport belt. This is where you can use underground belts. 

tutorial-chapter-9-step-8-header=About underground belts part 1
tutorial-chapter-9-step-8-detail=The underground belt item is actually the entrance chute for an underground belt segment. You rotate the item to face the same direction as the belt on the ground and place it down to create the entrance chute.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-9-header=About underground belts part 2
tutorial-chapter-9-step-9-detail=You can place another underground belt chute up to 4 tiles away. The chute needs to face the same direction as the entrance chute, and the preview will read whether it is connected. When you place a connected chute, the underground belt segment is created automatically between the two chutes and for free. The underground segment does not interact with anything including any other underground belt segments.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-10-header=Build the copper smelting row
tutorial-chapter-9-step-10-detail=Build your copper smelting furnace row with the same design as the iron smelthing furnace row.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-11-header=Extend your metal plate belts
tutorial-chapter-9-step-11-detail=When your copper smelting area is completed, next extend your iron plate belt and your copper plate belt to a new empty area where you can use rows of assembling machines to make iron gear wheels and automation science packs. Use underground belts if needed. This new area will need to be about 20 tiles wide and at least 30 tiles long.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-12-header=Place a row of assembling machines
tutorial-chapter-9-step-12-detail=Extend your two belts directly side by side across the middle of your new area. Place 6 assembling machines along one side with 1 tile of space in between the machines and the belt, and again 1 tile of space between neighbouring machines.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-13-header=Configure a row of assembling machines
tutorial-chapter-9-step-13-detail=Configure the first assembling machine in your row to make iron gear wheels. This machine will be fast enough by itself to supply up to 10 assembling machines making automation science packs. Configure the 5 other assembling machines to make the science packs. You can use the entity settings copy-paste shortcuts here, which were "__CONTROL__copy-entity-settings-info__" to copy and "__CONTROL__paste-entity-settings-info__" to paste.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-14-header=Place iron gear wheel inserters
tutorial-chapter-9-step-14-detail=Place an inserter to feed the iron gear wheel assembler with iron plates. You will need either a regular inserter or a long handed inserter, depending on how you arranged your belts. Behind the assembler, place a regular inserter for taking out the gear wheels. 

tutorial-chapter-9-step-15-header=Place the output belts
tutorial-chapter-9-step-15-detail=Craft transport belts, and starting from the iron gear wheel output inserter, create a new belt that runs along the back of the row of machines. This will be your iron gear wheel belt for supplying the science pack assemblers. Next, create a new belt parallel to the iron gear belt, and this one will be used to collect the finished science packs from the row.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-16-header=Complete the science pack assembling row
tutorial-chapter-9-step-16-detail=Place inserters and long handed inserters and power poles as necessary so that your machines are all working or full.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-17-header=About machine rows
tutorial-chapter-9-step-17-detail=You have now used all 4 easily accessible belts around this row of assembling machines but the row gets the job done. The row can be extended easily if you want a larger factory overall. Spaced out machine rows like these are the core concept of building extendable factory areas of any kind. You can create all kinds of rows like this, and learning about more techniques such as belt lanes will help you come up with different designs.

tutorial-chapter-9-step-18-header=Use the science packs
tutorial-chapter-9-step-18-detail=You can extend your science pack belt to go to a row of labs. With 5 science pack assemblers, you can easily run 5 to 10 labs continuously. You will need to extend your furnace rows and ore mining rows to feed your assembling machines. The overall factory size you want will depend on your target science research speed, but 5 automation science pack assemblers gives a fairly good speed. 

tutorial-chapter-9-step-19-header=The next steps 
tutorial-chapter-9-step-19-detail=With your power and basic research all ready to go, you are ready to keep exploring new technologies and growing the factory. In general, your goal should be to aim for the next science pack until you are ready to build the rocket silo. New systems, resources, and challenges will become available to you along the way.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-1-detail=Chapter 9, Tips and tricks

tutorial-chapter-10-step-2-header=Picking up items 
tutorial-chapter-10-step-2-detail=You can hold "__CONTROL__pickup-items-info__"to pick up nearby items on the ground or on belts.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-3-header=Menu search
tutorial-chapter-10-step-3-detail=As you unlock more types of items and your menus become larger, it might be easier to find something in a menu using the menu search box. Press "__CONTROL__menu-search-open__" to open the search box and type in the item name and press "ENTER" to save the search term. You can then press "__CONTROL__menu-search-get-next__" to run the search on almost any menu. In some menus you can also search backwards by pressing "__CONTROL__menu-search-get-last__".

tutorial-chapter-10-step-4-header=Copy pasting machine settings
tutorial-chapter-10-step-4-detail=You can copy paste settings such as assembling machine recipes or building filters so that you do not hav configure them every time. You can copy the settings of a selected machine by pressing "__CONTROL__copy-entity-settings-info__" on it and paste the settings on another machine by pressing "__CONTROL__paste-entity-settings-info__" on it.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-5-header=Belt fullness reflects production issues
tutorial-chapter-10-step-5-detail=In general, if you aim to have more machines filling a belt than emptying it, you can expect the belt to usually be full. This is useful for identifying belts quickly, and also any empty belt would be a sign to indicate a production problem.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-6-header=Leave extra space
tutorial-chapter-10-step-6-detail=There is usually plenty of building space that you can find or create easily. Aim to leave at least 10 tiles of space between different production areas since you never know when you might need to pass a new belt through an area.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-7-header=Rebuilding is normal
tutorial-chapter-10-step-7-detail=It is a normal part of Factorio to pick up all the buildings in an area and build something new and better. This is a great solution when you are feeling stuck.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-8-header=Instant mining tool
tutorial-chapter-10-step-8-detail=You can clear a large number of buildings using the instant mining tool. Press "CONTROL + X" to take it in hand and press "__CONTROL__clear-cursor__" to remove it. In this mode every building the cursor touches is instantly mined. You can also instantly area mine every building within 10 tiles of the cursor by pressing "__CONTROL__mine-area__" while this tool is in hand. In contrast, area mining without the tool in hand will only target obstacles such as trees and rocks and items on the ground.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-9-header=Machines take only what they need
tutorial-chapter-10-step-9-detail=You may have noticed that inserters do not try to completely fill up building input slots. The rule they use is to gather enough input ingredients for two more crafting cycles but not more, so that the majority of materials can remain on the belt or in the chest in front of the inserter for other inserters to use. The same applies to inserters refueling machines, except for trains.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-10-header=Production has ratios
tutorial-chapter-10-step-10-detail=It is feasible to use any number of machines that you want for any task, but in general there are numerical limits and ratios to help guide things. For example, three assembling machines making copper cable are precisely enough for supplying two assembling machines making electronic circuits.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-11-header=Power management
tutorial-chapter-10-step-11-detail=It is a good idea to keep track of your power grid. Examining any electric pole will report how its power grid is doing. Low power will slow down machines but they will keep on working, although if your coal mining drills slow down too much they might not be able to catch up with the demand from your boilers and you will have to disconnect part of your factory until your coal supply is restored.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-12-header=Warnings menu
tutorial-chapter-10-step-12-detail=You can press "__CONTROL__open-warnings-menu__" to open the warnings menu. In addition to check machine statuses, this menu can identify some factory problems for you.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-13-header=Mall building
tutorial-chapter-10-step-13-detail=While producing science packs is the main goal of a factory, it is also a good idea to make the factory also produce items and buildings for you to use yourself, like assembling machines making assembling machines for you. You can dedicate some output chests or a design an area for this. The community likes to call these areas "malls" or "hubs".

tutorial-chapter-10-step-14-header=Lab chaining
tutorial-chapter-10-step-14-detail=Research labs have a handy feature where an inserter can take any science pack from one lab and put it in another. You can use this idea to make a simple chain of labs, where only the first one needs to be supplied from a belt or a chest.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-15-header=Chest slot locking
tutorial-chapter-10-step-15-detail=Chest inventories have a special feature where you can lock slots, starting from the last one and up until the first one, using "PAGE UP" or "PAGE DOWN". Locked slots can be emptied by inserters as usual, but they cannot be filled by inserters. Therefore you can limit how much a chest can be filled, and thus how much it drains your factory resources.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-16-header=Transport belt lanes
tutorial-chapter-10-step-16-detail=Transport belts have two lanes, and inserters prioritize the lanes using specific rules. When you split or merge or sideload belts, lanes interact in specific ways. You can safely ignore the lanes when you use only one type of item for each belt. Learning and using lane management later on can allow you to reliably transport two types of items on each belt instead of one, or to use the full capacity of a belt when high item traffic is needed.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-17-header=Check a building's  status
tutorial-chapter-10-step-17-detail=You can check a building's current status and some other stats like its health level by pressing "__CONTROL__read-entity-status__" on it. This will help with figuring out any issues with your production.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-18-header=Area scanning
tutorial-chapter-10-step-18-detail=Area scanning allows you to analyze a specific square area around your cursor. To use it, press "__CONTROL__toggle-cursor__" to toggle Cursor Mode and then press "__CONTROL__cursor-size-increment__" and "__CONTROL__cursor-size-decrement__" to change the cursor size. For cursor sizes greater than 1 the cursor reports all the found entities within its area. You can press "DIRECTION KEYS" to move the cursor by its size for each press and scan a new area every time, or you can press "ARROW KEYS" to move the cursor by only 1 tile at any cursor size. You can then press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-distance-and-direction__" to get the relative position of the cursor box.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-19-header=Directional scanning
tutorial-chapter-10-step-19-detail=If you want to examine entities in a specific direction only, you can press "__CONTROL__scan-facing-direction__" to scan the direction you are facing, which is the direction of the cursor from you when you press "__CONTROL__read-cursor-distance-and-direction__". In addition to entities strictly in that direction, diagonally located entities within 10 tiles are indexed as well.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-20-header=Chunk charting
tutorial-chapter-10-step-20-detail=The scanner tool is limited by how much of the world has been charted. You can chart more areas at the edge of your map by walking to them, or by using radars, which will scan nearby tiles instantly and further tiles slowly. You need to chart every location only once, for the scanner to model the topography.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-21-header=Combat
tutorial-chapter-10-step-21-detail=While it was not mentioned so far, depending on the planet you landed on, you might need to worry about enemies in the area. It is a good idea to produce bullets and research basic military technologies just in case.

tutorial-chapter-10-step-22-header=More info at the wiki
tutorial-chapter-10-step-22-detail=While the basics are covered here, there are several more features and tricks and shortcuts that you can find on the Factorio Access Wiki.
